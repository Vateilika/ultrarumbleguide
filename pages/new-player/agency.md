In this sub-guide you'll learn about the agency system and agency leagues and rankings. To read about ranked points and individual player rankings click this sentence!

# Agencies: Intro
Agencies are this game's equivalent of clans/guilds. The utility of an agency is that of boosting the amount of gold and experience you get, as well as giving you extra tickets if your agency qualifies high enough in the rankings, or even skins in agency events. Different agencies have different expectations, some might be half dead, some might just be "do what you want", and others might be more competitive and set seasonal point quota to aim for higher placements in the agency rankings.

In terms of interaction between agency members, it can depend. While the game offers a text chat inside the agency screen, higher ranked agencies usually have a discord server for this, which can also be used to meet up in-game and play with other agency members. A popular trend among agencies (mainly higher ranked ones) is to all share a specific symbol or acronym at the beginning of their name, such as "IRS Gojo", "x Gojo", "ZEN Gojo" or "CSEN Gojo".

To access the Agency Screen, simply click the "Menu" button on the bottom right of the screen and then the image button that says "Agency".

# Agencies: Joining
When opening the agency screen, you will be greeted by a list of agencies. You can either choose to join one of them, or you can choose to refresh for different options, or you can also use the "Filter" option on the top left to find one that fits your criteria. Some agencies are set as "Join", which means you can simply join them with no issues, however, others are set to "Apply", which means that you can't join them instantly, instead, you will have to wait for an agency member with enough permissions to accept you.

If you want to join an agency you've found out about outside the game or in another player's profile, you can just go to the "Filter" option and type in the agency's ID code to find the exact agency.

# Agencies: Creation
Another option you have is to create your very own agency by going to the "Create Agency" tab on the top right of the agency screen. Creating an agency is completly free, you don't need wealth, fame or power, just sheer faith in what you're doing. When creating your agency, you will be able to give it a name, a description, set up a few details about it, and choose an emblem for it. The name you choose might not be allowed if it contains a banned word, a common issue is "ho", any word containing "ho" is banned, sad for those in christmas season.

# Agencies: The Gameplay
Agencies have 4 tabs: Main, Member, Records and Bulletin Board.

## Main
Aside from the main info like the agency's leader and agency description, you will find a few features. The first feature is License EXP Boost, a button only agency leaders and co-leaders can press that for a limited amount of time will trigger a License EXP Boost. You should try to play as much as possible while this boost is active to level up your license as fast as possible.

The second feature is white "Menu" button on the right, where you can invite people to the agency, leave, see the amount of people that applied to join the agency (and accept/decline them if you're a leader/co-leader), or change the agency's information if your authority is high enough.

The third feature are the three donation points: Aid Center, Gym and Agency. You can level these up by using Agency Points, which are blue orbs with the letter over them.<br><br>
Leveling Aid Center will increase the amount of Contribution Points your agency gains, which are basically the Agency equivalent of ranked points.
Leveling Gym will increase the amount of Player EXP you gain. Not the most useful thing.
Leveling Agency will increase the amount of Gold you gain, not really a resource you will often find yourself lacking if at all.

Leveling these three donation points is important to raise the overall Agency Level, which will allow the agency to sustain more members, as new agencies can only support 10 players, while max level agencies can support up to 40 players.

On the left side you might also see stuff concerning leagues, but that's for later in this sub-guide.

## Member
In the member tab you can see every player currently in the agency and whether or not they're online. You can also see their Contribution Points and even send them likes. The player with a golden flag is the leader, while silver flags represent co-leaders.

Leaders from agencies tha tcare about their ranking often use the "Sort" button on the upper left side to sort members by Most or Least Contribution Points, so remember to use this if you're the leader of an agency aiming for the top.

## Records
Here you will see general notifications such as an agency member's winstreak or other changes to the agency.

## Bulletin Board
The agency's chat, that's really it.


Reaching Beginner II requires 1,000 pts, while reaching Beginner III requires you to reach the 2,500 pts mark. Once you leave Beginner III and reach the next rank, you won't be able to be demoted back to Beginner, even after a seasonal reset.

</p>

To leave Beginner III you need to get to 4,500 pts. Once you do that, you will reach Amateur I. Unlike Beginner, Amateur has 4 sub-ranks, and it does have an Entry Cost. 
- Amateur II is reached at the 8,000 pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 150 pts until you reach this rank.
- Amateur III is reached at the 13,000 pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 200 pts until you reach this rank.
- Amateur IV is reached at the 21,000 pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 250 pts until you reach this rank.

</p>

After Amateur Rank follows Pro Rank, also known by some as "Gold". You can be demoted to a lower Expert rank if you lose enough points, but you cannot be demoted back to Amateur Rank. The point requirements and Entry Costs are as follows:
- Pro I is reached at the 33,000 pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 300 pts until you reach this rank.
- Pro II is reached at the 47,000 pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 500 pts until you reach this rank.
- Pro III is reached at the 63,000 pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 550 pts until you reach this rank.
- Pro IV is reached at the 81,000 pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 600 pts until you reach this rank.
- Pro V is reached at the 101,000 pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 650 pts until you reach this rank.

</p>

After Pro Rank follows Expert Rank, also known by some as "Obsidian". You can be demoted to a lower Expert rank if you lose enough points, but you cannot be demoted back to Pro Rank. The point requirements and Entry Costs are as follows:
- Expert I is reached at the ??? pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 700 pts until you reach this rank.
- Expert II is reached at the ??? pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 800 pts until you reach this rank.
- Expert III is reached at the ??? pts mark, and your base Entry Cost will be 900 pts until you reach this rank.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/expert3.png" width="200"/>
</p>

After Expert Rank follows the final rank, Ace Rank. Unlike Expert, Pro, Amateur and Beginner, Ace does not have sub-ranks. Once youv'e reached Ace you've basically hit the summit, as there are no more ranks after and you'll obtain the last batch of ranked rewards. To reach Ace Rank you need to reach the 126,000 pts mark. The journey between Expert III and Ace will have an entry cost of 1,000 pts, which will increase to 1,100 pts the moment you reach Ace Rank.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/ace.png" width="200"/>
</p>

However, the grind is not truly over after reaching Ace, since the game offers an actual ranking featuring the 2,500 players with the highest ranked point count. Thsoe below the top 1,000 will get a small amount of tickets, while those that are in the top 1,000 get extra rewards, those who reach top 500 get even better rewards. The top 100 players get the 2nd best rewards, while the top 10 get the best of the best. The difference in terms of non-cosmetic rewards is pretty low, so if you're not somebody with a lot of time then this might not be worth it, but if you do have time, then you can play some more and squeeze some extra tickets. The ranking can be viewed-

</p>

There's also another ranking that gives players rewards: The Billboard Chart.
When opening profiles, you will see a like button. Clicking it will send the player "likes". You can send likes by clicking on an agency's member name in the agency member list or by using the like button in Spectator Mode while you're dead in match. Just like the normal ranked ranking, those below the top 1,000 get a few tickets, while those in the top 1,000, 500, 100 and 10 each get a better set of rewards.

To access the base ranking (MVP) and the Billboard Chart, just click the "Menu" button on the bottom right and then click "Rankings".
