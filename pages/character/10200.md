Ibara is a support-class character with a unique twist: she usually operates like a heavy sniper. Your objective is to keep enemies away from you and your team using your Alpha ability, hold key positions on the map, and turn the tide of battle with instant revives.<br>
<br>
As a key member of your team, and a non-mobility character, you will often be targeted by enemies, but with your large HP pool and high close-range Beta damage, you have every chance to stand your ground against even the strongest characters in the game.

Ibara's Alpha skill is a truly unique and powerful long-range attack. This ability features two firing modes: un-aimed and aimed.
The attack's uniqueness lies in the short-lived residual effect it leaves behind. Any enemy who steps or flies into it takes the full damage of the Alpha ability.

**Un-aimed Mode**<br>
In un-aimed mode, Ibara will spread her vines across a wide area with okay range, however, this version is significantly less likely to hit enemies, partly due to the gaps between each of her vines, and it's highly discourage to use this version of alpha against aerial targets, as the spread doesn't help much. This version is excellent for controlling chokepoints like doors and stairways, denying areas in rooms, or exposing enemies hiding in smoke or bushes, so for these situations un-aimed mode should be used.

</p>

**Aimed Mode**<br>
Most of the time, your focus should be on the aimed mode rather un-aimed. In this mode, Ibara will fire a concentrated vine shot that deals high damage and has much longer range than her un-aimed version, and is also both ideal to hit air targets and a significantly more reliable version. Furthermore, two ticks of the alpha ability are guaranteed to knock enemies back, allowing you to maintain a safe distance, prevent an enemy from escaping, or shake a threat off your teammate.

**Barrier Piercing**<br>
A crucial feature of Ibara's Alpha is its ability to pierce through enemies and many of their defensive mechanisms. This allows it to damage multiple opponents in a line, even if they are protected by shields. Below there is a list of skills that Ibara's Alpha can pierce through.

It's important to remember that some defensive mechanisms are considered terrain and cannot be pierced by Ibarra's Alpha. These include all of Cementoss's structures, Shoto Todoroki's ice walls and icicles, Momo's shield in deployed state, and Full Bullet’s Gamma. When colliding with these obstacles, Ibara's Alpha will attempt to move around them or over them, following the same rules as with any map geometry.

**Mastering your Alpha: Feel The Flow**<br>
Ibara's Alpha is a finicky yet fascinating ability with incredibly diverse interactions with map terrain. Unleash your imagination and head into training mode. Start shooting at everything you see and observe the Alpha's behavior. It is far from intuitive, especially for a new player. Below are examples of some of the most common interactions.

</p>

**Trajectory Thinking**<br>
A vital step towards fully mastering Ibara's Alpha is to start thinking in terms of its trajectory. Recall how you play other characters. Most often, a character's Alpha skill is a projectile resembling a sphere—a single point that must directly connect with an enemy's hitbox.

With Ibara's Alpha, however, you are not firing a point, but an entire line that persists in the air for a short time. Simply put, you don't need to aim directly at the enemy's model. It's often enough to shoot at their feet, and the Alpha will extend to reach them. If an enemy is climbing a wall, you can shoot at its base. If they are flying through the air, you can create a barrier in their path that they will fly into.

**Accept the Randomness**<br>
Ibara's Alpha can be random. This is barely visible in aimed mode but you can clearly see it in un-aimed mode. Randomness causes unintended behavior that is simply beyond your control. Sometimes it favours you, sometimes it doesn’t.
IdkWhatKindOfGifImSupposedToPutHereTho

**Value your ammo**<br>
Even at level 9, Ibara only has 4 Alpha charges. At level 1, she has a mere 2. Every shot is a chance to deal up to 160 damage (depending on your level) and knock an enemy back. Every miss leaves you vulnerable and allows enemies to close the distance.

The cost of any mistake on a low-mobility character is incredibly high. Treat every miss as a significant mechanical error. Dedicate yourself to training your accuracy and constantly improving. Most importantly, avoid situations where you spend all your Alpha charges in the heat of battle and are left with none.

Ibara's Special Action is an incredibly powerful ability and her true killer feature. She carries two instant revives with a pretty long range. Using this ability wisely can single-handedly turn the tide of a battle, which is why you will constantly be the primary target for other teams. To revive an ally, you do not require a direct line of sight; the ability works through walls and other obstacles, even if you or your teammate are in the air. Using this ability mid-air will stop you from falling for a moment.
<p align="center">

</p>

It’s crucial to feel the range of this ability. Despite its long range, teammates tend to scatter around, and sometimes, they can get too far from you. Make sure to close range with your ally before they get DOWNd.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A simple 3-hit melee chain. Despite having a deceitfully wide-looking slash, Ibara slows down before every attack, so the range on these is too short to be used reliably. Ibara prefers using her Beta and Gamma skills to repel close-range aggression. Despite being an unreliable tool, Ibara has several niche combos that start off her melees. They will be described later.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

A single slash with thorny hair. It is slightly more reliable than her original ground melee chain because this is literally the only skill in Ibara’s kit that doesn’t slow her down. But sadly the downpower of this move doesn’t let you to combo it into anything but your gamma.

## Leveling Paths
### Alpha Level 4 is a must
Your combat potential before reaching Alpha level 4 is incredibly low. With only two charges, you will often be useless in fights. That third charge, along with the extra range and larger projectile size, is crucial for your consistency. Remember, you start the game with two revives. Sometimes, the correct play is to let a teammate be downed so you can secure the early levels you desperately need, just make sure you’re close enough to save them. Getting drawn into early battles can leave you under-leveled, and failing to hit Alpha level 4 will have severe, long-lasting consequences for your entire match. Landing on an uncontested golden box to secure your loot is a good strategy to hit your Alpha level 4 ASAP.

<hr style="height: 5px; background-color: white; border: none;">

### Balanced Path A
This is a balanced build path. After getting Alpha to level 4, proceed to upgrade Beta to level 4. The level 1 Beta has a very small range, which leaves you vulnerable to close-range aggression. Securing Beta level 4 allows you to protect yourself much more effectively. Afterwards, prioritize Alpha level 9 to become a formidable long-range fire support.

</p>

### Balanced Path B
This is another viable path, focused on close-quarters combat and zone control. The level 9 Beta is an incredibly strong, nuke-like attack that melts your enemies and is excellent for catching opponents on their wake-up. You should use this path if there are a lot of melee threats in your lobby, or if you are forced inside a building during the final circles of a match.

</p>

### Balanced Paths Tip
If you are not confident in your playstyle and don't know which path to choose, let random guide you. Get to a4 → b4 first, and then start saving your upgrade cards in your inventory. Both level 9 skills provide a significant power spike. You will eventually find your Alpha and Beta cards, and your teammates might even bring you some.
You should use your universal cards (Level-Up Cards) right before a fight to secure key levels first. For example, let's say you have Alpha level 5 and Beta level 8 before a fight and only 3 universal cards. Use them to get that Beta level 9 and invest any remaining cards into your Alpha before you engage.

<hr style="height: 5px; background-color: white; border: none;">

### Sniper Path
Sniper path is viable for experienced players in a coherent team if they trust their aiming abilities. The downside of this path is that you’re leaving yourself vulnerable to close range threats and give up on catching your enemies on wake up.

On the other hand, you receive a significant range and projectile size boost earlier in the game. Your alpha is a great third-partying tool  and a great fire support for your teammates. It disrupts your opponent's moves and prevents them from escaping, which makes this path especially good for snowball tactics if your teammates are competent.

Space Hop users may prefer this path over balanced paths because high jump allows you to evade some close-ranged threats even in open areas and provide you with unexpected, long angles to shoot.

</p>

### Why don't we recommend level up Gamma?
Gamma is a high-risk, high-reward tool. Missing it leaves you completely vulnerable. Furthermore, leveling up Gamma only increases its release damage. In many situations, your teammates can knock the enemy out of your grasp, causing you to miss out on that key source of damage entirely.
While its purpose is to punish close-range aggression, your Beta ability is a more reliable and consistent tool that fully covers this need without the same associated risk.
