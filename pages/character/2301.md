Endeavor is hot af fr fr, but that's not the main point, because pain is the only thing that can prove one's regret and acceptance of guilt, the past cannot be fixed, so look forward, vaporize those tears, and accept the weight of your sins. Forgiveness is not to be expected, shake those delusions away. Fulfill your role, and only then, maybe, you will be forgiven, but remember, that's not your end goal, it's your miracle.

## Alpha Skill - Inferno Fist: Jet Burn

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch023_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Endeavor punches forward, firing a flame resembling his fist. When the fist collides with a surface, it expands into flames in the surrounding area. Up to two of these flames deal tick damage over time and last for approximately 6 seconds. Tick damage from a flame puddle is applied immediately, meaning aiming at an enemy's feet deals more damage. than normal. Additionally, since the flames persist, it is ideal for use in choke points such as fatal funnels and doorways. Additionally:<br>
<br>
- Projectile Travel Speed: Moderate, lead your shots heavily.<br>
- Pierces through enemies, multiplying damage.<br>
- Tick damage from a flame puddle is applied immediately.<br>
- Only two fire puddles can exist at once. Once a third is cast, the first dissipates.<br>
- Tuning damage affects fire.<br>
- Jump and hover to evade damage while firing.<br>
- Can be used in tandem with Special Action Dash backwards, then canceled into alpha as a backward/kite tool.<br>
- The fire puddle is effective against melee-oriented opponents when cast underfoot or in doorways.<br>

## Beta Skill - Vanishing Storm & Hell Curtain
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch023_Unique2.png" width="400" />
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch023_Unique2_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Endeavor spawns a tornado at a chosen location, staggering anyone caught within its radius. Once the tornado dissipates, Hell's Curtain forms a ring around the Vanishing Storm. Should an enemy come into contact with the Curtain, they will be pulled toward the center, allowing for strategic Jet Burns on the target. The Curtain persists for an extended period, making it ideal for edge-guarding melee opponents or for use in choke points such as fatal funnels and doorways.

**Vanishing Storm**<br>
- Can be placed at great distances away, on top of surfaces, on walls, and roofs.<br>
- Instantly staggers everyone caught inside.<br>
<br>

**Hell Curtain**<br>
- Damages through walls.<br>
- Features a mirrored downward portion that is typically hidden.<br>
- Place on walls to utilize this portion of the attack.<br>
- An enemy will be permanently trapped if caught between the Curtain and a wall, bouncing indefinitely until death.<br>

## Gamma Skill - Prominence Nova
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch023_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Endeavor raises his right arm and begins charging an orb of flames midair. After a short time, the attack can be fired. However, this technique can be charged further to dramatically increase the scale and size of the blast. Once sent forward, upon colliding with a surface, it will explode and gradually grow in size. Enemies caught within suffer damage over time. This move currently has collision issues if it collides with anything other than the ground. Additionally, it will not hit around corners, behind any object or obstacle, or through walls.
- Projectile travel speed: Slow; lead your shots very heavily.
- Hold to increase explosion size
- Hold to extend suspension time in the air.
- Does not penetrate walls.
- Deals no damage when thrown against a wall typically.
- Can be used to intercept enemy wake-up attempts.
- Can be used to snipe airborne opponents if you can predict their movements.
- Detonates mid-air upon reaching maximum distance, useful for edge-guarding distant enemies.

</p>

**Dash**<br>
Endeavor dashes forward at a stable altitude, immediately draining 10% of the gauge and then slowly draining more. This maneuver can be steered left or right.
- Can be canceled with air melee to retain momentum.
- Can be tapped backward and canceled into α as a backward/kiting tool.
- Can be canceled by not inputting any movement and reactivated to make sharp turns.
- Is infinite during the "3, 2, 1, GO" countdown at the beginning of a match. You can spawn on a crate with a near 100% chance to escape.
- Retains all I-Frames. It is 100% safe to wake up and dash away for a short distance.
- Do not sprint off ledges; roll off them instead. This is objectively faster and will not accidentally trigger his Special Action.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301mA2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Hover**<br>
Endeavor suspends himself midair, slowing his horizontal movement speed, and slowly draining your gauge.
- Can be spammed to drain less gauge.
- Strafe left and right while attacking to evade damage.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special Action #2 - High Jump
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch023_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Endeavor leaps upwards or diagonally, draining 50% of your gauge. It is best used mid-air due to a significantly faster activation speed compared to on the ground.
- Castable up to three consecutive times before gauge is fully depleted.
- Goes straight up if input without directional movement.
- I-frames are lost upon casting.
- Gauge consumption occurs only after the move has fully activated.
- Incline can be canceled with alpha, useful for landing on buildings without overshooting.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

Endeavor's melee involves a flaming punch. Opponents struck by it will be set ablaze. This attack requires close proximity to land effectively. The initial hit of the melee is crucial as it serves as the combo starter. Subsequent melee actions hinder combo execution. Therefore, to initiate a combo, press the melee button, pause briefly, and then press it again, ensuring you do not activate the second part of the melee. Also to note, When you use your finish move on an opponent, after it says "opponent knocked out", use your melee to cancel the finish off animation so you can immediately pick up their loot.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Endeavor's aerial melee is a flaming kick that propels him forward. This can initiate a combo, chaining an aerial melee into a standard melee onto one of his abilities. Endeavor's aerial melee also provides movement. When jumping or falling, use the aerial melee for improved mobility. This also applies to Endeavor's special action Dash. Using the aerial melee during a dash grants additional movement and conserves the special action's percentage gauge.

Aerial melee will give you momentum:
- After SA Dash
- After β
- After rolling off a ledge
- After climbing a ledge
- After knock downed wakeup

## Leveling Paths
### Jet Burn Path
Focus on maximizing α damage. Play Endeavor similarly to Nejire or Assault Deku, utilizing alpha's damage for safety and pressure. This playstyle is optimal with alpha tunings and consistent shot landing. Beta should primarily be used to set up alpha. This strategy is particularly effective against aerial opponents like All for One (Young), Nejire, Hawks, Tamaki, Lady Nagant, and Monoma.

</p>

### All's Tornado Path
Jump start your alpha, then go all in on the beta. Not viable in lobbies with plenty of aerial opponents such as All for One (Young), Nejire, Hawks, Tamaki, Lady Nagant and Monoma

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Endeavor's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 100 DP (Projectile), 20 DP (Lingering Fire)<br>
Beta Skill: 10 DP (Per Tornado Tick), 50 DP (Curtain), 50 DP (Upon Activation)<br>
Gamma Skill: 65 DP (Per Damage Tick), 0 DP (The Projectile Itself) 
Ground Melee: ?<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP?<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

### Beta -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha
Another niche combo to add 25 damage to your beta if the situation is right. This combo allows you to deal 236 damage, but most of the time, you’d rather not risk missing a melee.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 1 -> Beta -> Alpha
A very niche combo that is worth using only in a situation, where you don’t have your beta. It’s much harder to land, but the damage is very similar. Allows you to deal damage above beta's up close.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301c2-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Beta
A highly dangerous combo that combines high damage with target control. It locks an enemy in place to deal 295 damage before tuning, with 225 of it going straight to HP, ignoring shields.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301c3-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Gamma
This is another combo based on a similar principle. It locks the opponent in place for an even longer duration, dealing 325 total damage. However, it only works reliably in an isolated 1v1 scenario. Keep in mind that landing a ground melee could be harder than air melee.

Mastering the ways of hellflame means that On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign, we ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell, bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again, we know
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside, you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard, now can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Endeavor can struggle against Deku if Deku lands a Gamma or has very good aim. However, Deku is not a significant threat to Endeavor.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Endeavor does not have significant issues with strike Deku. Although Deku can become difficult to hit when airborne, Endeavor can combo him with Beta and Alpha if Deku's Beta attack misses.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
OFA Deku is a melee-focused character who will constantly attempt to close the distance. However, this plays to your advantage at close range, where your Beta ability can rapidly delete his HP. Furthermore, as a Rapid character, OFA Deku's players often fail to utilize their i-frames effectively. This makes punishing them on wake-up significantly easier.
<br>

## Katsuki Bakugo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Bakugo can deal significant damage with his Gamma ability and remain airborne for a short period. However, this is not a major problem for Assault Endeavor.
<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Assault Endeavor finds it very difficult to deal with a rapid Bakugo. A rapid Bakugo is almost always airborne, making it challenging to land any of Assault Endeavor's moves. Therefore, you should not face a rapid Bakugo alone.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Endeavor has significant difficulty against Ochaco due to her high mobility, which makes landing attacks extremely challenging. Avoid combat most of the time unless she is on the ground.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Assault Ochaco can inflict significant damage, but her moves are easily dodged. When she uses her charged Gamma to ascend, utilize the special action high jump action to position yourself above or onto the floating platform and execute the Beta Alpha combo.
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Iida's speed and movement make it very difficult for Endeavor to land attacks. Iida needs to be close to attack, so you'll have to be patient and wait for him to come near you, if you see an Iida coming towards you, use your beta ability around you, and he will be hit by it. Also play around your curtain walls and your jet burn flames
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Endeavor can have either a rough or easy time dealing with Shoto. If you encounter Shoto, it is advisable to stay airborne, as his Gamma ability can freeze you and inflict significant damage. Therefore, ensure you remain airborne or closely monitor his movements; otherwise, you should be fine unless the Shoto player has exceptional alpha aim.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Shoto can be punished by Assault Endeavor in buildings because Endeavor's Beta ability goes through walls, giving him an advantage. Endeavor does not have difficulty fighting Shoto, and Shoto cannot pursue Assault Endeavor into a building since Endeavor can place a Beta there.
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Endeavor will have a hard time hitting Froppy when she uses her Alpha. However, when she attempts to attack, she can be punished if you use your Beta when she is about to attack you. You can trap her, allowing you to combo her.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Kirishima will have a rough time fighting an assault-type Endeavor. However, if he can land some hits, he will do good damage. Try not to be too close to an assault-type Kirishima.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch008var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Strike Kirishima's good movement can make it difficult for Endeavor to land hits. But If Strike Kirishima's Beta attack misses, you can do  Beta Alpha combo.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Denki is a mid-range fighter who is most dangerous at medium range. You have the advantage in both long-range and close-quarters combat. The Super Armor on your Beta prevents you from being shocked by his Gamma. This allows you to evade his most deadly combo while dealing significant damage to him. He’s also relatively an easy target for your alpha.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Lightning) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch007var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
While Technical Denki can be annoying at long range with his auto-lock Alpha, he becomes an easy target while using his aimed mode. Unlike Strike Denki, his DPS is relatively bad, making him significantly less dangerous. His only mobility tool is his Gamma, which has an easy-to-punish startup animation.
<br>

## Momo Yaoyorozu <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch010_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Momo Yaoyorozu is another grounded character who has a hard time escaping your Alpha. You can pierce her shielded dash and overwhelm her up close. However, you must pay close attention to her Gamma cannons and avoid getting cornered in the building filled with those.
<br>

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
A fight against Monoma heavily depends on what quirks he copied, but as a character with insane mobility and air stalling potential, he’s generally a dangerous opponent. If you catch them up close, you clearly have an advantage, but usually, he will try to stay a long distance. He also has a slim hitbox, which is quite hard to hit.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch046_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Itsuka Kendo is a very melee-centered character. However, unlike Assault Kirishima, she does not have a hardened state and you can pierce her shields, making it relatively easy to keep her at a distance. The battle becomes riskier if she gets up close, but it remains fairly even. Your Beta can trade with her Gamma, and a well-timed roll can create an opening for you to catch her with your grab move.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch046var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Very Unfavorable🔴<br>
Strike Kendo possesses a very dangerous Alpha that causes flinch with every hit. She has decent mobility, and her Beta grants her Super Armor. Furthermore, attacking her beta may cause a powerful counterattack.
<br>

## Ibara Shiozaki <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch102_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
In the mirror match-up, the match-up is decided by two factors: Aim for other alpha and recognition of wake-ups. The Ibara who can time their wake ups and counter the others will be the victor.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch024/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch024_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Mirio is a high-mobility character who is very hard to hit. Luckily, the nature of his Alpha makes it relatively easy to dodge, which often turns this matchup into a standoff. Your best strategy is to dodge his Beta and punish him with any of your abilities. Keep in mind that if you land your Gamma at level 9, you can one-shot him.
That being said, Mirio is extremely dangerous if he catches you in a vulnerable position, as his superior mobility makes escape nearly impossible.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Sheer Counter) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch024var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Technical Mirio is an extremely dangerous threat. His ability to deal damage while remaining completely invulnerable is a serious problem for a low-mobility character like Ibara. However, you still have counter-play options at close range, as your Gamma does not trigger his counter. You can bait it out and catch him with your Beta or Gamma, which may be fatal for him. A good tip for Space hop users is to jump over his Beta and shoot him when he pops out.
<br>

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
The battle between Shiozaki and Amajiki often comes down to who spots the other first. Both sides have abilities which can be used to counter the other. Leaving the result to be whoever is better versed in said character.  Keep in mind that he has a powerful  grab move, and he can become invisible after hitting the Beta skill. If possible, avoid fighting him in open space.
<br>

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Despite Nejire’s flight, Ibara is well versed in dealing with enemies within the air by using her alpha. That being said, trying to fight her in Open skies will lead to much more rolling and dodging than attacking. Bait her inside of enclosed spaces and/or buildings to allow your beta and gamma room to finish her off.
<br>

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Ibara’s kit forces her into a stationary position, making her a prime target for Shinso’s alphas. Ibara is best played as a secondary target against him. Using alpha’s to save someone or getting close enough to gamma him during his alpha combos. Be careful with your i-frames, a lot of Shinso players will try to catch your wake up.
<br>

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While Ibara gamma can snag his beta and her alpha can stop his Gamma, that doesn’t make this battle one sided at all. The combination of his special action leap and alphas are still more than capable enough to melt an unsuspecting Ibara. Your main focus is to keep him in your sights and stay aware of the splash damage his alphas hold. However, his bulky hitbox and delays on his mobility moves makes him an easy target for your alpha.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
The match-up is one that comes down to who catches the other first.  All might holds the advantage of armoring through attacks and high amounts of mobility. Meanwhile, Ibara takes the lead in terms of range and damage. With both sides having stats that can help to fight the other, it comes down to a battle of skill and who can get the drop on the other first.
<br>

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Despite her alpha being useful in saving someone from his gamma, her kit makes her extremely stationary. Making her a prime target for his combos quite similar to Shinso. Another downside of this match-up is his mobility; it's very fast and unpredictable, making it incredibly hard to snipe him. A well-levelled beta helps a lot in this match-up since Aizawa will always try to close range on you.
<br>

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
The best way to treat mic is similar to a turret. In the time it takes Ibara to fire one shot, he’s likely fired up to 3-4 or even 5 shots onto her. His alphas are extremely hard hitting and come out extremely fast, which is also boosted by his special action which is available to him at all times. In addition to that, his gamma ping is not stopped by beta or Gamma, forcing you to avoid the punch or take it, with high levels of varying damage.
<br>

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While Ibara’s scoped vines can climb a Cementoss tower, a majority of the fight will be spent rolling his alphas and gammas as he retains a position upon a cement tower. Making it hard to damage him without taking equal or more damage in the process.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Despite his high attack power, Endeavors attacks are easily telegraphed, allowing you to counter and/or roll his attacks. Well-placed alphas are excellent for shutting down his special action flight as well as his gamma. His large hitbox allows you to hit him more consistently than other targets.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
In this battle against AOE, while her Alpha can prevent his gamma, his beta trap as well as Aoe alphas make countering back quite risky. While you can use air stalling to prevent grounded alphas, it doesn’t do much against direct hit alphas.

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While rapid hawks maintains higher mobility and lock-on alphas which can/ will pepper her, Ibara retains a sole advantage in her beta and gamma being able to slow/ halt his beta, which is his largest damage source. His special action flight makes him a predictable and easy to hit.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Strike hawks has a special gimmick once his abilities his lvl 7. One of which being he no longer staggers on his beta. Which can have deadly consequences as Ibara’s beta is her best get off me tool. This change leaves her open for one of his many combos.

## Mt Lady <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch100/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch100_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score (Small Form): 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Difficulty Score (Giant Form): 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Mt. Lady in her small form follows the trade of a melee fighter, which makes her susceptible to beta or gamm, though beta gives more protection against her stomp. The main point of this match-up is to not give her the chance to use alphas, which don’t do as much damage as All might’s but can still deal a decent amount of damage.

In her giant form, while can still do damage to her, Ibara’s lack of mobility and escape tools make her susceptible to the goat Sonos and kicks. Quickly whittling down her health pool.

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Despite having large Aoe and constantly making the floor unusable, this match-up is actually much more even if Ibara uses her air-stall. Which allows her to attack and momentarily avoid his for as long as she can air stall. In addition, her gamma can also capture his gamma, premiering damage. Though only if timed correctly.  If you play this match-up correctly, Shigaraki will be completely unable to hit you most of the time.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Though having more movement and his attacks are now projectiles, his abilities lose their AOE status that his predecessor version had. Making him easier to deal with. However, the same trick does apply. Use air stalling to prevent his maximum damage. As his abilities still need to hit the ground to do their most amount of damage. If he attempts to get closer or land on you with his gamma, Beta can be used as a punish. But even though we mark this matchup as favorable, his beta->gamma combo may be quite devastating.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
While both characters hold a reputation of slow or stationary, Ibara can take full advantage of his by range. His gamma offers two different courses of action you can use, these being alpha if you avoid getting caught or Beta if you do end up being caught. Cancelling the damage altogether.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Not only can he take away her revives, but his large AOE and delayed attacks make the battle difficult for her lacking mobility to avoid said attacks. His gamma super armor makes him especially dangerous because he becomes nearly invulnerable to your alpha knockdown, but knock you down with every gamma charge.
<br>

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Ibara’s alpha has the special capabilities to ignore both Tech Dabi’s Gamma and beta, his best protective abilities. Also, with him also lacking movement, allowing Ibara to easily punish his wake-or even cancel a follow up gamma. In addition, he alpha negates the barrier his special action revive holds. Making it simpler to take him down.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Similar to Tech Dabi, Ibara’s alpha can go through his gamma explosions. Even better, however, is the fact that she can negate his beta entirely with a well timed beta. While you may still get lifted up, you will take none of the damage.

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Tech Toga can beam opponents with alpha which can be fought with well placed alphas. Her beta can also be a tool which can be stopped with a wide beta or an extremely well timed gamma. The best time to grab her is when she begins her slashing charge as she’ll sometimes power through your gamma during. But it wouldn't be a problem if you shut her movement with well-placed knockdowns.

The most important part of the match up, however, is to avoid her gamma. As getting caught by it gives her access to your revive.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Unlike her tech counterpart, her rapid skillset is much less predictable. While a well timed Scoped alpha can interrupt her mid-air gamma, it’s more likely that you’ll get sight in her large zone beta or shredded by her boomerang like alpha. Making short work of Ibara’s stationary health bar. That being said, you will be prevalent, if you successfully predict and punish her movement. Rolling her beta shuts down most of her combos.
<br>

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Twice is a very straightforward character that Ibara should be able to deal with rather easily. While he can snag her with his gamma, a well-placed beta or gamma removes any worry

That being said, twice is dangerous if does manage to get behind you and you don’t notice. As he can use his clones to quickly remove your health bar if you’re not paying attention.

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This match-up relies on  staying up close and personal with him. While you can challenge him with your alphas at a distance, as well as go through his beta with your moves, up close offers more potential. Potentially forcing a gamma which you can cancel with beta or gamma.
<br>

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Ibara’s stationary playstyle makes her a prime target for Kurogiri’s beta combo. As well as a fine target to be shredded by his alphas. In a direct duel, you will have an advantage, if you hit your alphas consistently enough, but his ability to teleport you away and break your positioning makes him a significant threat. 
<br>

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Overhaul is a grounded character with comparably large hit box. You should focus him using your alpha, from a long range or a high ground. THis way he will have hard time hitting you. Close up, he can be threatening, but his combos are not fatal and you can succefully trade with him using your beta skill. Keep in mind that his special action can knock you away when you old him in your gamma. Double tap it to end your gamma animation earlier while maintaining most part of your damage.
