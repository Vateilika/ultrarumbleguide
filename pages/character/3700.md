Twice throws a series of knives; each hit slows the target. A great tool for control and starting a combo. Used for distance control, keeping enemies away and slowing them down, as well as a final blow or to finish off those who try to run away. Do not rely too much on this skill, althought it does quite a lot of damage (if you hit with all 3 knives), but be careful when you get closer to the enemy or vice versa. At the moment, due to the nerf to Twice, he cannot stop his alpha skill with his gamma, so you need to be careful with this so as not to get into a situation where you will not dominate.

## Beta Skill - Self Duplicate

Twice's beta skill allows him to create a clone that attacks nearby enemies. These clones can only use Alpha or his basic Melee attacks, and they die when hit once (even by non-damaging moves), when using beta again before the clone has died, or when enough time has passed. They can be used as distraction, as with the right spacing and positioning they won't be able to take them down with an AoE attack, meaning they will either have to take clone damage while attacking you, or kill the clone and give you a window to attack them while they aren't attacking you.<br>
<br>
Clones are your hidden ace up your sleeve, so release the clone immediately after entering the battle or to counterattack opponents when you retreat. Sometimes, the clone can even be used as a living shield to hide from enemy shots. Do not release clones into nowhere, wait for a convenient moment, and when in battle, summon the clone mid combo to create pressure.

Twice's gamma skill is a short-ranged rapid dash forward on a measuring tape that stuns the opponent for a second enabling basic combos, and brings you closer to them. Some usages are to start the battle first and fly into the enemy, or to quickly escape enemy fire in an unfavorable situation, as this skill is Twice's mobility. Keep in mind though that this mobility option is slow, so unless you can fly behind obstacles, you will likely get beamed down to death if you dare to use it as such in the open.

## Special Action - Mud Imitation

Toga's special is the most important part of her kit and what her gameplan comes back to. To transform once you get blood you press the special button and to detransform you press crouch twice quickly. You can act immediately after detransforming. Important to note that toga detransforming with her AoE or Traps active from a character she copied (Tech Dabi for example) become only visual with no damage or disappear.

Transforming has many reasons such as using another character's strengths that toga can take advantage of like AoE characters to control space, revive characters to keep your team alive, mobile characters either to chase or run and so on. She also can transform and detransform quickly to reset her own cooldowns if staying as base toga is preferable in that situation.

A lot of the difficulty in playing her comes from knowing how to play other characters efficiently. It's recommended you have a good understanding on how to play the whole roster but you don't have to master them all. When looking to transform you should value how confident you are in playing the character over just their strength, I advise having 3-6 characters in your pocket that you play well and play reliably to get the most use out of them.

The biggest double-edged sword however is that the enemy you copy and their team have you highlighted so you can use it to your advantage and confuse them but in practice it's easy to point to you and single out who's who, this is why unless the character you copy is good at handling multiple people or you can escape from them it's not advisable to transform if you have a whole team's attention on you- instead try do so during chaos and diversions like 3rd partying or your teammates taking attention if your aim is to disorientate people. Another option is to kill that person and use their blood in a fight with another team so you get the benefit of transforming without being traceable. Just don't forget that while you're transformed, your location is visible at all times by the team you stole blood from.

Lastly, Toga generally would prefer to play transformations out as long as she can before detransforming due to below average dps on her kit outside of alpha but don't get too attached to your blood either and detransform if you have to.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A simple 3-hit melee on the ground that has short range but good speed. You won't be in the position to use this a lot of the time as Toga wants to keep distance but it is a good wake-up catching tool and you can time each press a little slower to account for when your opponent's i-frames end. This also combos well into beta and with the addition of tuning it doesn't hurt to know some detransform into melee combos.

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

A simple 1 hit slash in the air that probably gets better use as mobility aid than as an attack. Using it after a jump can increase your travel distance slightly but when really high up it's useful for air strafing.
