# <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">GENERAL ESSENTIALS: Terminology, I-Frames and more!</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about the essentials for a player that is moving towards the General Player category, here you will learn some useful terminology, and idk what else rn.

# Terminology
Here you will learn terminology often used by players ranging from basic to more advanced. ORdered in alphabetical order (for the first term of a pair).

- 3rd Party: Attack an enemy that is already fighting somebody else, often as a mere happenstance or to take advantage of a vulnerable enemy.
- Aggro: To aggro is to focus a target, and to take the aggro means to take the enemy's focus.
- Air Stalling: Purposefuly trying to remain in the air as long as possible, often really far above from the ground, in order to avoid being attacked or making some players lose interest in you.
- AoE: Area of Effect, the area of an attack.
- Beamers: Characters who rely primarily on projectiles, such as both Bakugos.
- Blues: GP Drinks
- DoT: Damage Over Time, for example, the Burn and Decay statuses are DoTs.
- Downpower/KV: The knockdown units an attack applies. If a character receivers 500 of these in a short enough window of time, they will be forcefully be knocked down, giving you invincibility for 1~ second or until you use an ability or melee attack.
- Flesh: When an enemy has no GP. You’ll probably hear this as “This person is flesh!”
- Greens: HP Drinks
- Hitstun: The period of time after being attacked where the player who got hit cannot do anything. The time varies depending on the move the player gets hit by.
- I-Frame: Invincibility/Invulnerability Frame, it refers to the seconds of invincibility you receive from actions such as being revived or recovering after being hit with max knockdown skills. I-frames make your character glow white.
- Kiting: Run away from an opponent while attacking to discourage chasing.
- Pinks: Full Revive Cards.
- Pity: A mechanic used in gacha games so players are guaranteed to get what they want after a certain amount of rolls has been done. In this game’s case that would be the “Exchange” system on banners.
- Punish: Let or force someone to make a mistake such as being in a bad position, using and/or missing an attack or action that leaves them open for a good amount of time, falling prey to a stun etc. for you to follow up, capitalise and attack them once they are vulnerable.
- Rainbows: Level-Up Cards (not ability cards).
- Rat/Ratting: A tactic where you purposefully hide for a large portion of the match.
- Res/Rez: Resurrection.
- Ruby/Topaz/Sapphire/Emerald/Amethyst (CardS): Refers to Strike/Assault/Rapid/Support/Technical Ability Cards respectively.
- Shields: Sometimes used as an alternative name for GP.
- Storm/Circle: The Poison Mist.
- Storm Camping: A tactic where you remain inside the Poison Mist for a long amount of time with the goal of staying there as long as your HP healing items supply makes it possible.
- Stun: Can be used to refer to hitstun, or to refer to other types of stun such as Denki Kaminari's shock paralysis or Hitoshi Shinso's Special Action.
- Superarmor/Hyperarmor/Armor/Armored: Some skills give a character "superarmor", which makes it hard for their attack to be interrupted. Hyperarmor is just another term for it.
- Thirst/Thirsting: When a player is adamant about finishing off a DOWNnd player and ignores other enemies to achieve this.
- ToD: Touch of Death, combos that can kill you even at full HP and GP.
- Teamheals: Team Recovery Items.
- Wake-Up: The action of recovering from the strong impact of an attack. More on this later.

# Mechanics: I-Frames, Downpower, Knockdown, Knockback and Hitstun

If you've been playing the game you might have noticed that receiving some attacks slow you down slightly, while some others actually keep you in place while receiving them, the latter are Hitstun attacks. A good example would be Mr. Compress' alpha skill (the marbles he throws) and Momo Yaoyorozu's alpha skill. Hitstuns are essential for combos, as they keep the player locked in place so that they can keep receiving attacks without being able to fight back.

Some skills might be powerful enough to blow you away, however, there are two types of "blown away": Knockback and Knockdown.
Knockback is when the attack simply blows you away but you can still take damage while you're falling. This happens with Assault All Might's beta skill and Assault Ochaco Uraraka's alpha skill (the projectile). On the other hand, a knockdown is almost the same thing, except that you also gain i-frames (invincibility frames) in the process if you just keep falling. To difference both, just look at your character. If he's glowing white while it's falling, then it's a knockdown, otherwise it's just knockback.

In this game, every skill inflicts an amount of "Downpower" (DP). When a character receives 500 DP in a short amount of time they receive a knockdown, gaining invincibility frames they can use to quickly reposition or think. Without this system, you would have to react immediately to every strong attack, making surprise attacks way too effective, but thanks to downpower you can get a break. Combos attempt to exploit the low DP of some skills to deal the biggest amount of damage before you receive knockdown. Below you have examples of being hit with low DP skills and being hit with high DP skills.

# Mechanics: Wake-Ups

A wake-up or recovery is the action of recovering from falling or hitting the ground, which gives you i-frames for slightly longer than a second. There are 3 types of Wake-Up:

- Air Wake-Up: When an attack blows you away but you cancel the fall so you don't hit the ground, that's an Air Wake-Up. It's the fastest type of wake-up, but it's a terrible choice against some characters or abilities, since you're i-frames will expire while you're in the air, a position from which you have limited options.
- Hop/Jump Wake-Up: If you let your character fall and hit the ground, but then do a little hop to recover yourself from that state, then that's a Hop/Jump Wake-Up. It's a good option if you want to gain some time but still be fast. If an Air Wake-Up would be a bad play in your situation, you can use this instead.
- Ground Wake-Up: The slowest type of wake-up, but a very useful one. This type of wake-up can let the enemy react better to your actions, which is problematic, but you also get to stall and gain some time for your skill or special action cooldown to come back, or for an ally teamheal to arrive and heal you.

We could further split these wake-ups into full or short wake-ups. If you use an alpha, beta or gamma skill, a melee attack, or the special action button (but not passive special actions like Endeavor's flight), you will cancel immediately the i-frames given to you by the wake-up. Cancelling these i-frames early allows you to act faster but also means you surrender your "protection" sooner. However, if you don't use any of these skills and simply press the movement keys, jump, or dash, then you will be able to retain the full duration of your i-frames to survive slightly longer. The difference matters a lot in higher level of play, where some people expect you to "waste" your i-frames by using a skill early, so they attack you slightly before so that when the enemy attack reaches you, you have cancelled your i-frames, taking the attack and losing more health. However, if you keep your i-frames, then the enemy might attack you with a skill while you're invincible, dealing no damage to you but leaving them in a vulnerable position that you can take advantage of to fight back.

Knowing which option to use is key, and your needs change based on your enemy and the character you're playing, as well as whether some of your skills or enemy skills are available or still in cooldown. Experience will tell you when to wake-up and when to not, but overall, characters with low or no mobility, and with slow animations prefer to delay their wake-up as much as possible, since if you have slow attacks you can be attacked while they're activating.

# Mechanics: Superarmor/Hyperarmor

If you attack an enemy but receive an attack back, chances are you will be blown away. However, some skills allow the character to resist this, being able to keep attacking without being pushed away or hitstun'd. The abilities with this property make the character glow yellow. Skills that grab characters ignore the armored property. Kirishima's Special Action is a good example of this, as while he has it active, he's very hard to blow away or interrupt.

# Mechanics: Dodging/Rolling to Avoid Damage

The dodge/roll movement type is not purely aesthetic. While you're rolling, you receive brief i-frames that last for less than a second. These i-frames aren't visual, so you won't see your character glowing white, but you still have them, and you can use them to avoid the damage or effect of skills, which is why sometimes even though an attack landed on the enemy they received no damage. Every skill is technically dodgeable, in the sense that no skill is able to cancel i-frames, however, the damage area of some skills linger for longer than usual, so if the lingering time is higher than the duration of your i-frames, you won't be able to dodge it. The duration of the lingering can make a skill easy to dodge, hard to dodge, or impossible to dodge fully.

# Mechanics: Cooldown Management

This game has two types of cooldowns: Normal Reload and Penalty Reload.
When a skill has more than 1 ammo/charge (let's say 5) and you use one, then that skill will start reloading at a rate marked by the Normal Reload. However, using every charge before they can fully reload will trigger Penalty Reload instead. In many characters this difference isn't all that important, as both can roughly have the same duration, or perhaps the character has the means to defend itself even without that skill. However, some characters or skills have more demanding cooldowns, so you want to not overuse them and instead spread your skill usage between your 3 skills + Special Action instead of spamming one specific skill. An example of this is Rapid Hawks, who even though can easily run away from battle, if he has his Special Action and beta skill in cooldown (his main forms of mobility), then he will have a hard time escaping from that situation, potentially getting him killed.

If your character is cooldown-demanding you will quickly feel it, in which case you will have to learn to better spread your skill usage so that you don't run out of valuable skills.

</p>
Strike Characters focus on damage and/or aggressive playstyles. Characters like Present Mic, Red Itsuka Kendo, Red Denki Kaminari, Red Shoto Todoroki and Red Tomura Shigaraki can deal outstanding amouns of damage in little time. Carrying characters with this class gives the whole party a damage boost that grows higher the more characters with this class are on the team:<br>

</p>
Assault Characters can focus on defense and close-combat (like Yellow Itsuka Kendo and Yellow Eijiro Kirishima), have massive attacks that cover a wide area and are often slightly slow to execute (Yellow Endeavor, Young All For One, Mt Lady) or remain in a more neutral/all-rounder ground (Yellow Deku and Yellow Tomura Shigaraki). Carrying characters with this class gives the whole party a defense boost (damage reduction) that grows higher the more characters with this class are on the team:<br>

- 1 Assault Party Member: x0.95 DMG Reduction Boost
- 2 Assault Party Members: x0.90 DMG Reduction Boost
- 3 Assault Party Members: x0.80 DMG Reduction Boost

Characters with this class are often referred to by the community as "Yellow" or "Assault", after which follows the character's name.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/icons/twice_rapid.png" />
</p>
Rapid Characters focus on agility and/or speed, they're often highly mobile and slippery characters that usually have an easy time moving from one place to another, and sometimes even be difficult to hit due to their agility or staying in the air for long. These character's are usually characterized by having the lowest HP on the game, which makes them more fragile than the rest of the cast in that regard. Carrying characters with this class gives the whole party a speed boost that grows higher the more characters with this class are on the team:<br>

- 1 Rapid Party Member: x1.05 Speed Boost
- 2 Rapid Party Members: x1.10 Speed Boost
- 3 Rapid Party Members: x1.20 Speed Boost

Characters with this class are often referred to by the community as "Blue" or "Rapid", after which follows the character's name.

## <a style="color: lime !important;">**Support - The Protection and Revival Class**</a><br>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/supportbig.png" /></br>

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/icons/overhaul_support.png" />
</p>
Support Characters focus on interrupting the enemy with abilities that easily stop their movement and/or abilities to block exits, as well as often possessing other helpful skills like healing (Overhaul) or resurrection (Ibara, Cementoss) skills. Keep in mind that even though these characters have support characteristics, they very well work as competent damage dealers, sometimes even performing better than characters in the Strike Class. Carrying characters with this class gives the whole party a Recovery Item Effect Boost that increases the amount of healing you receive from recovery items and grows higher the more characters with this class are on the team.<br>

- 1 Support Party Member: x1.10 Recovery Item Effect Boost
- 2 Support Party Members: x1.25 Recovery Item Effect Boost
- 3 Support Party Members: x1.50 Recovery Item Effect Boost

Characters with this class are often referred to by the community as "Green" or "Support", after which follows the character's name.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/icons/toga_technical.png" />
</p>

Technical Characters focus on unusual or/and miscelaneous abilities, such as traps (Dabi), or abilities that perform really well indoors, or other unique abilities like Mirio Togata's counter, Neito Monoma's metal form or Tomura Shigaraki's Search. Carrying characters with this class gives the whole party a reload speed boost that grows higher the more characters with this class are on the team.<br>

- 1 Technical Party Member: x1.10 Reload Speed Boost
- 2 Technical Party Members: x1.25 Reload Speed Boost
- 3 Technical Party Members: x1.50 Reload Speed Boost

Characters with this class are often referred to by the community as "Purple" or "Tech", after which follows the character's name.<br>
