# <a style="color: rgba(255,245,138,255) !important;">Special T.U.N.I.N.G. Info and Resources</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about the effects of Special T.U.N.I.N.G. skills, as well as useful resources to truly know in detail the extent of some Special Tunes, extra info and visual examples!

# Strike Special Tunes

## Kota Finder
Kota Finder lets the player see Kota's location on the minimap by placing an icon with his head in his location. Technically you can also see him through walls, but this only works well if you're really close, in which case you will be able to see his silouhette colored yellow or red depending on the device you're playing on.

It's recommended that players using Kota Finder play a high-mobility character so that they can quickly reach Kota's location. Because Kota is hard to see from far distances, it's recommended that players press M to open the minimap and place a ping in Kota's location so that you can see his position while moving towards him, and also to let your teammates know. It's also recommended to either pick the middle of the map or a spot that is close to the majority of Kota's spawn locations. Kota Finder should also preferrably be on the right Special Tuning slot rather than the left, as at max level you will know his location as soon as the countdown hits zero and the match starts, while at Level 10 you will have to wait 8 seconds. It surprisingly not that bad at low level if you're playing in lower ranks, as people there often don't run Kota Finder.

Kota Finder is a risky special tuning skill, since even though rescuing Kota gives you a huge advantage, you will only get value out of it if you're successful rescuing Kota. If another team gets him before you, you will be sitting with a useless tuning for the rest of the match. For that reason, people might prefer Divine Protection, which is more versatile and can get you more value than Kota Finder, just a bit later. Pay attention to Present Mic (the announcer) for mentions of Kota (even if you play with Japanese Audio), as that will indicate that an enemy team already claimed him. Some people equip Speedy Civilian Rescue to rescue Kota as fast as possible, however whether or not this is a good strat is up for debate.

</p>


Leveling Kota Finder reduces the time it takes for it to activate, the higher the level, the sooner it will activate.
- Level 1: 1 Minute
- Level 2: 56 seconds
- Level 3: 52 seconds
- Level 4: 48 seconds
- Level 5: 44 seconds
- Level 6: 24 seconds
- Level 7: 20 seconds
- Level 8: 16 seconds
- Level 9: 12 seconds
- Level 10: 8 seconds
- Level 11: Instant

## Crushing PU Charge
Crushing PU Charge lets you gain PU gauge with every KO. If you get KOs often, this can allow you to extend your survivability through higher PU availability and even quickly get it back after if you keep getting kills. At levels 10-11 it grants 19-20% PU per kill, which means that you're guaranteed to get PU in 5 kills, but you will often get it sooner thanks to natural PU generation.

Leveling Crushing PU Charge will increase the amount of PU you gain per kill.
- Level 1: 1% PU
- Level 2: 2% PU
- Level 3: 3% PU
- Level 4: 4% PU
- Level 5: 5% PU
- Level 6: 15% PU
- Level 7: 16& PU
- Level 8: 17% PU
- Level 9: 18% PU
- Level 10: 19% PU
- Level 11: 20% PU

## Resist Heat
Resist Heat prevents fire abilities (such as the Todoroki Family's and Armored All Might) from inflicting the Burning status, however, it only does this for 1 hit, after which it enters a cooldown (which isn't even zero at maximum level) before you can get this fire immunity again. Because fire damage can only be applied by a select few characters, often does basically no damage, and this tune has a cooldown; it's often regarded as one of the worst special tunes in the whole game, being overly situational, trying to stop a gimmick that barely affects the player, and not even succeeding wholy at doing so. Don't bother with this tune, it's basically useless, no like really why does it even exist, why, why, why?????? WHY, WHAT WAS THE THOUGHT PROCESS, I SWEAR TO 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/resistheat-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Resist Heat decreases its cooldown, allowing it to activate sooner.
- Level 1: 70s Cooldown
- Level 2: 65s Cooldown
- Level 3: 60s Cooldown
- Level 4: 55s Cooldown
- Level 5: 50s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 21s Cooldown
- Level 8: 17s Cooldown
- Level 9: 14s Cooldown
- Level 10: 10s Cooldown
- Level 11: 5s Cooldown

## Resist Shock
Resist Shock quickly cancels paralysis induced by electric moves that apply shockpower (Denki Kaminari only), however, it only does this for 1 hit, after which it enters a cooldown (which isn't even zero at maximum level) before you can get this paralysis immunity again. Because Denki Kaminari is the only character capable of paralyzing and this special tune has cooldown it is seen as one of the worst special tunes in the game, attempting to stop a very specific character but failing to do so properly. It's not as bad as Resist Heat, but still, don't use it, basically any other tune would work better even in the situation where Resist Shock would be at its peak of utility.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/resistshock-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Resist Shock decreases its cooldown, allowing it to activate sooner.
- Level 1: 70s Cooldown
- Level 2: 65s Cooldown
- Level 3: 60s Cooldown
- Level 4: 55s Cooldown
- Level 5: 50s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 21s Cooldown
- Level 8: 17s Cooldown
- Level 9: 14s Cooldown
- Level 10: 10s Cooldown
- Level 11: 5s Cooldown

## Willpower
Willpower allows the user to resist a hit that would otherwise kill them, triggering knockdown on themselves and surviving at 1 HP. This tune is actually quite liked due to it's "2nd Opportunity" effect, which on characters that can manage to run away at 1 HP without being killed is really good, but kinda less effective on characters that cannot get out from the situation they've been put into. Against multi-hit attacks, this tune might fail to trigger, DOWNing the user, which can be frustrating. This tune is also good for non-PUR costumes, as you can still survive a lethal hit with 1 HP, just less often. You can also use Willpower to land one extra hit on the enemy to kill them if you know they're low and you just needed one extra attack to finish them off.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/willpower-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

Leveling Willpower decreases its cooldown, allowing it to be available sooner.
- Level 1: 12 minutes
- Level 2: 10 minutes
- Level 3: 9 minutes
- Level 4: 8 minutes
- Level 5: 7 minutes
- Level 6: 3 minutes and 30 seconds
- Level 7: 3 minutes
- Level 8: 2 minutes and 30 seconds
- Level 9: 2 minutes
- Level 10: 1 minute and 30 seconds
- Level 11: 1 minute


## Iron Fist
Iron Fist increases the user's damage by 5% after landing a basic melee attack. This effect lasts for 10 seconds, and has a cooldown 13-10 seconds cooldown at levels 10-11. While not the best damage increase out there, it can come handy on melee heavy characters (especially Izuku Midoriya OFA) to increase their damage output overall and trigger its effect often, especially effective when running it along with Embrittlement. It's not recommended on characters that don't land many melees or that don't want to land them too often, as the 10 seconds duration favors characters that can trigger it repeatedly. Not the best choice, but also not the worst.

Leveling Iron Fist decreases its cooldown, allowing you to trigger it sooner.
- Level 1: 60s Cooldown
- Level 2: 55s Cooldown
- Level 3: 50s Cooldown
- Level 4: 45s Cooldown
- Level 5: 40s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 22s Cooldown
- Level 8: 19s Cooldown
- Level 9: 16s Cooldown
- Level 10: 13s Cooldown
- Level 11: 10s Cooldown

## Ability Manifest
Ability Manifest allows the user to increase the duration of Ability Cards, allowing to expand on this mechanic. This is quite an interesting tune that can be used to either make Ability Cards a big plan of your playstyle, or simply to boost their duration whenever you need to make a little use of them, like when using a Support Ability Card after being struck with powerful skills (or to camp or heal inside the Poison Mist). 

Below is a comparison highlighting how much Ability Manifest increases the duration of Ability Cards at Level 11.
- Level 1: 5s -> 8s
- Level 2: 11s -> 18s
- Level 3: 17s -> 27s
- Level 4: 23s -> 37s
- Level 5: 29s -> 46s
- Level 6: 35s -> 56s
- Level 7: 41s -> 66s
- Level 8: 47s -> 75s
- Level 9: 53s -> 85s

Leveling Ability Manifest increases the duration of Ability Cards, allowing you to make them last longer.
- Level 1: +10% Duration
- Level 2: +15% Duration
- Level 3: +20% Duration
- Level 4: +25% Duration
- Level 5: +30% Duration
- Level 6: +35% Duration
- Level 7: +40% Duration
- Level 8: +45% Duration
- Level 9: +50% Duration
- Level 10: +55% Duration
- Level 11: +60% Duration

## Trance Blow
Trance blow allows the player to inflict the Trance status onto the enemy by landing a basic melee attack, slowing their Movement and Attack Speed, fogging their view and hiding ally tags. Trance Blow is really good when it comes to hindering the enemy and make it harder for them to escape, as they become much slower. However, the Trance status effect has a hidden variable that makes it a bad choice on characters that would normally seem like they'd love this tune, and that is the fact that Trance triplicates the amount of Downpower they receive, meaning that you won't be able to perform most combos on enemies with the Trance status (same applies for Shinso's gamma skill), for this very reason you should be mindful in who you give this tune to or how you decide to play around the Trance status.

Leveling Trance Blow decreases its cooldown, allowing you to inflict Trance more frequently.
- Level 1: 60s Cooldown
- Level 2: 55s Cooldown
- Level 3: 50s Cooldown
- Level 4: 45s Cooldown
- Level 5: 40s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 22s Cooldown
- Level 8: 19s Cooldown
- Level 9: 16s Cooldown
- Level 10: 13s Cooldown
- Level 11: 10s Cooldown

## Booming PU Voice
Booming PU Voice allows the user to send out soundwaves that apply the "Deafen" status to close enemies when activating PU, allowing you to stun them and use it as a combo starter, or making it easier to flee as they won't hear where you're going inside complex structures. While the utility it provides isn't bad, it being restricted to only activating on PU use really holds it back, as the one time you get to use it you won't even get much benefit from it if at all, plus, much better options exist both for this slot color and for PU activation effects. You don't really want to run this ever unless you want to try it out for the fun of it, but even then you will only have 1-2 attempts per match, and the range is also pretty short, shorter than Shinso's Level 9 gamma.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/boomingpuvoice-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

Leveling Booming PU Voice decreases the duration of the Deafen effect, allowing it to last longer.
- Level 1: 4 seconds
- Level 2: 4.5 seconds
- Level 3: 5 seconds
- Level 4: 5.5 seconds
- Level 5: 6 seconds
- Level 6: 9 seconds
- Level 7: 9.5 seconds
- Level 8: 19 seconds
- Level 9: 10.5 seconds
- Level 10: 11 seconds
- Level 11: 12 seconds

## PU Power Intensified
PU Power Intensified is a powerful special tune that increases your overall damage by 50% (relative to Level 9) during Plus Ultra (which normally increases damage by 20%), allowing the player to deal massive damage to enemies that will often catch them off-guard. This special tune is incredibly powerful, but it also has a drawback, that being the fact that it lowers the time PU remains active. At maximum level, you lose 5 seconds out of the 15 that PU normally lasts, essentially losing 33% of your PU time. This can be a pretty huge drawback, since not only is this tune limited to PU, but you could also get stunned or knocked down and lose precious PU time. It's also the only special tune that actually makes the player weaker if used at low levels, where it makes PU last for only 3-4 seconds.

You can combine PU Power Intensified with Full Burn, a special tune that increases PU duration, but this mean you have to use two slots for a benefit you will only get during Plus Ultra, and whether it's worth it or not will depend on the character. On some characters, this combo can work well and get you many kills in crowded circles.

Contrary to what the icon might suggest, this special tune does not turn your PU aura red.

Leveling PU Power Intensified decreases the amount of PU Duration you lose from equiping this tune.
- Level 1: 4 seconds
- Level 2: 4.5 seconds
- Level 3: 5 seconds
- Level 4: 5.5 seconds
- Level 5: 6 seconds
- Level 6: 9 seconds
- Level 7: 9.5 seconds
- Level 8: 19 seconds
- Level 9: 10.5 seconds
- Level 10: 11 seconds
- Level 11: 12 seconds

Tuning is a game system that allows players to create unique builds that significantly increase their character's power, defense, supportive capabilities, and mobility. It offers a wide variety of effects, from minor stat increases to those that completely change how you play.

Each tuning build is exclusive to the outfit you apply it to, meaning you’ll have to equip the character's tuning by going to your chosen outfit and selecting “Tuning Equip”.

In simple terms, this system allows the player to equip 10 small buffs (each with 1-2 attributes, such as Alpha DMG, Defense against Gamma skills, more health, etc...) and 2 small passive abilities known as Special Tunes.

# How to tune a character
To tune a character, you must first select the costume you wish to tune. Keep in mind that PUR and non-PUR costumes have different tuning effectiveness, which will be discussed later.

After opening the menu, you will see two sets of tuning slots. The five smaller slots are arranged in a row, with a single large, special tuning slot above them. The small slots are referred to as Normal Tuning Slots and the large ones are referred to as Special Tuning Slots.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/tuningtuto3.png" width="60%"/>
</p>

What you want to do is fill the left column column first (except the Special Tuning slot at the top), to do that just click a slot and pick one of the buffs in the right side. You can only equip them if you have 50 Character Data or Character Data Exchange Tickets, the latter can replace normal Character Data if you don't have enough, but only for characters you own, for characters you don't own however you rely on luck to get enough of their Character Data from playing matches (which is how you obtain these materials).

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/characterdata.png" width="20%"/>
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Currency/T_ui_Thumb_2_40000_S.webp" width="20%"/>
</p>

When attempting to fill these slots you have to keep this in mind:

- Each slot has a color that matches one of the 5 classes, you can only equip tunes of battle styles that match that class, so red slots only support strike tunes.
- You cannot equip Normal or Special tunes that match your character, so Bakugo can't equip neither Strike Bakugo's nor Rapid Bakugo's tuning.
- You cannot equip the same tuning twice in the same build.
- Some slots might be locked, to unlock them you need Slot Unlock Keys, if you have enough you can unlock a slot. On PUR Costumes only the right side is locked, while in Non-PUR costumes some slots in the left side are locked.
- Some slots might have an H (Hero) or a V (Villain), which means you can only equip either heroes or villains in those. Villain slots are particularily hard to fill due to the lack of villain battle styles this game has.
- If you don't have 50 of a character's data or 50 character data exchange tickets, you can use Hero Crystals instead, but this is NOT recommended, as Hero Crystals have way better uses.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/tuningtuto4.png" width="60%"/>
</p>

Once you've filled the left column, you will be able to setup the left column's special tuning (since special tunings can only be placed on columns that have all 5 slots filled), filling these takes 100 Character Data / Character Data Exchange Tickets, and instead of just having small buffs to specific stats, they have special effects, like Willpower which let's you survive a deadly hit at 1 HP, or Wall Runner that let's you run up walls.

To level up Normal Tunes you need Tuning Slot Enhancement Pieces (also known as white pieces), while for Special Tunes you need Special Tuning Slot Enhancement Pieces (black ones for Non-PUR costumes, rainbow ones for PUR costumes).

You can do all of this in the right column too, but you will have to unlock all slots in that one with keys (except the special one). Some locked slots in the right side (mainly in PUR costumes) have written on them "MAX LVL", this means that once you unlock that slot the max level of your special tunings will increase by 1, so you will be able to level them up again. In PUR costumes, unlocking slots also unlocks auras.

## Normal Tuning Slot
When you set tuning data in one of these normal slots, it grants your character a small passive effect. Each Normal Tuning Slot can be enhanced using Tuning Slot Enhancement Parts. The maximum level for a Normal Tuning Slot is 3, though certain slots can be upgraded to level 4. This is marked by either an H (Hero) or V (Villain) icon on the slot

Here is a small table to show you the effects of normal tuning slots:

## Special Tuning Slot
The large tuning slot above the five normal ones is called the “Special Tuning Slot”. It grants your character a small passive ability when specific conditions are met. The Special Tuning Slots are a crucial factor in deciding which costume to tune. You can only fill these if the Normal Tunes below are filled. They require 100 Character Data / Character Data Exchange Tickets to fill, and can be leveled up with Special Tuning Slot Parts (black for non-PUR, rainbow for PUR). Keep in mind that most special tunes are pretty limited and/or bad below Level 6, though a few still provide good benefits below level 6.

Special tunes can be leveled to different levels depending on the costume's rarity:
- For C and R costumes, the max level is Level 2 (left) and Level 3 (right), but unlocking the MAX LVL slot will allow you to push this to Level 3 (left) and Level 4 (right).
- For SR costumes, the max level is Level 3 (left) and Level 4 (right), but unlocking the MAX LVL slot will allow you to push this to Level 4 (left) and Level 5 (right).
- For PUR Costumes, the max level is Level 6 (left) and Level 7 (right), but unlocking the MAX LVL slots will allow you to push this to Level 10 (left) and Level 11 (right).
  
## Unlocking Slots
At first, the right column of Normal Tuning slots and both Special Tuning Slots are fully locked on Plus Ultra Rare costumes. To unlock each Normal Tuning Slot, you must use Slot Unlock Keys. Special Tuning Slots will be unlocked automatically after all five normal slots get filled with the data. Alternatively, any copies you get of a costume will unlock another slot. This is a rather unreliable way compared to keys unless you’re pulling on a banner with that specific costume and you get that costume again by sheer luck, this shouldn't be done on purpose though.

While using keys, the cost for unlocking slots depends on the rarity of the costume:
- C and R costumes require 1 Key to unlock each slot.
- SR costumes require 5 Keys to unlock each slot.
- PUR costumes require 50 keys to unlock each slot.

As said earlier, unlocking slots raises your special tuning max level (if you unlocked a "MAX LVL" slot) and grants you an extra aura (PUR Costumes only).<br>
<br>
Slots you've unlocked in one costume automatically unlock for all other 5 color variations of that particular costume.

This resource is used to upgrade the Special Tuning Slots on PUR costumes. Its primary source is the Hero License, though you also receive 100 of them from the Beginner Missions. Unlike the non-PUR enhancement parts, these 100 items will most likely be spent within a couple of seasons, as you need significantly more of them to fully tune a costume. The main sources are:<br>

</h2>
Character Data is used to fill both Normal and Special Tuning Slots. When placed into a suitable slot, it grants your character the effect stated in its description. You get 10-75 per match depending on your performance.

Character Data Exchange Tickets may be used instead of usual character data in case if you lack it, but unfortunately, it can’t be used if you currently don’t own the character whose data you want to set. You get 10-75 per match depending on your performance.

# Tuning Economy
You have probably noticed that you get a limited amount of tuning material each season. If we sum up every replenishable source of materials, you will get exactly:
- 5400 Tuning Slot Enhancement Parts (5,4 tuned PUR costumes)
- 27 Special Tuning Slot Enhancement Parts (5 tuned costumes)
- 60 Special Tuning Slot Enhancement Parts PUR (3,16 tuned costumes)
- 1050 Slot unlock keys (4,2 tuned costumes)
Keep in mind that you receive 400 Slot Unlock Keys from claiming all the daily Premium Login bonuses. This makes purchasing the Premium Login extra valuable for your tuning progression.
The 650 keys you get without it only allow you to tune about 2.6 costumes per season, which is almost half the capacity.

# Character Data Economy

A major challenge for all new players is acquiring Character Data. In the early stages of the game, you own very few characters. This means you not only receive less desirable data from matches, but you also cannot use Universal Data to "craft" the specific data you need for your build, making every piece of useful data extremely valuable. However, the system requires you to fill all five Normal Tuning Slots to unlock the Special Tuning Slot.
Therefore, a crucial tip for all new players is to never use the Character Data of a character you currently don’t own. While generally unadvisable, the data for certain characters can be considered expendable, even if you don't own them. Below is a list of characters with comparably weak Special Tuning Skills and whose data you can freely spend as a filler.

## True Fillers
Character data from the list below may be used freely as filler, as their special Tuning effects are severely underwhelming. 
- Shoto Todoroki (Default)
- Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame)
- Momo Yaoyorozu
- Denki Kaminari (Default)
- Tsuyu Asui
- Eijiro Kirishima (Default)

## Semi-Fillers
Character Data from this list may have an underwhelming Special Effect, but solid normal effect, or its special effect may have some use in specific builds. Using this data filler is unrecommended, unless it isn’t your only option. A good tip for these is to always have 100 of this data for future possible builds.
- Katsuki Bakugo (Machine Gun)
- Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike)
- Mirio Togata (Default)
- Nejire Hado
- Present Mic
- Dabi (Crazy Torch)
- Mr. Compress
- Kurogiri

# Universal Special Tunes
In this game, every character has a truly unique playstyle and a high diversity of potential builds. Below is a list of generally strong special tunes that will suit almost any character, but keep in mind they are not always the absolute best-in-slot for a specific character's optimal build.
If you have a suitable costume and the necessary character data, you should always aim for the best, most specialized builds. The tunings listed here, however, serve as excellent placeholders when you lack the ideal data, providing solid value for nearly everyone.

- Critical Permeation: This special tune skill provides you with 7 seconds of safety from enemies’ attacks when your shields break. In this state, you can still sprint and drink heals, but any quirk or special action you use will cancel this state early.
- Willpower: Upon receiving a deadly hit, you are instead knocked down with invincibility frames, leaving you at 1 HP. This tune is especially effective on characters with high mobility, as they have a solid chance to disengage and recover.
- Crushing PU Charge: Dealing a K.O. grants you up to 20% of your PU gauge. This tune allows you to activate your PU significantly faster and, potentially, use it multiple times in a single match.
- Extra Wind: This effect also speeds up your PU generation under a fairly easy condition. Whenever you level up any skill, you instantly gain 10% of your PU gauge. Note that this tune has a cooldown.
- HP/GP Sucker: This set of tunes is generally good for everyone. It replenishes your HP/GP, when you down an opponent. 
- Any Revenge Tune: Most of the revenge tunes are accessible from starting characters, which makes them extra affordable even for the new players, which makes it a perfect temporary solution. When your guard breaks, you receive a boost similar to activating an ability card for a set amount of time. 
- Quirk Factor Release:  This special tune increases the reload speed of all your abilities significantly, when you break the guard of your opponent.
- Acceleration: Despite it being a melee-based tune, the effect on it is so strong, it is worth using it, even if your character does not actively use their melees. Upon landing a melee, you receive a 20% speed boost.
- Wall Runner: Incredibly strong tune that gives you an ability to run up walls. This is a real saving grace for all non-mobility characters, but still works fine for pretty much everyone in the game.
- Space Hop: This Special Tuning Skill increases your jump height significantly, allowing you to occupy highgrounds easier and catch your opponents by surprise. It may be used in a combination with wall runner, but usually people choose Space Hop over Wall Runner, if their character can benefit from air time effectively and vice versa. 
- High-Speed Replenishment: At the start of the match reduces time to consume GP potions for 30%. This effect also applies to team GP drinks, but not Full Support Drinks.
- Card Duplication: At the start of the match, double the amount of ability cards you receive from the enemies you downed. This tune helps to build your levels faster, and works especially good  for players who love early aggression.
- Ability Manifest: Once you use an ability card, this tune effectively doubles its duration. This Special Tuning Skill is strong, but unfortunately, requires players to pay close attention to their ability card stock, May be unsuitable for newer players, who feel lost with their ability cards.

# Non-PUR tuning
If you are a new player, you probably do not have a desirable costume for a character you want to play, so the natural question arises: is it worth it to tune non-PUR costumes? Short answer: no. It is generally not optimal to tune non-PUR costumes because the maximum level on them is so low, that they will not be able to take significant benefit from most of the tunings in game and even though you don’t spend a lot of materials on it, you still lose a lot of valuable character data, but…

If you really want to play that exact character, and you have no PUR costumes at all, this might be your only option. Below is a list of tuning abilities that will be decent on R and SR rarity costumes:

- Willpower
- Foundation of Peace
- Revenge Technical
- Revenge Rapid
- Revenge Support
- Compression Magic
- Embrittlement
- Quirk Factor Release
- Fixer
- Ability Manifest
- Kota Finder
- Hyper Regeneration + Any Revenge Tuning
