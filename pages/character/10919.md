# <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">TEAMWORK: The Key to Success</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about Teamwork, the biggest fear of the average Ultra Rumble player!

# Introduction: The Power of Friendship
Teamwork is a crucial part of the game, even really powerful and experienced players can easily die without teamwork, but when the team is actually coordinated and actually follow some strategies, they can be absolutely terrifying and almost invincible in normal Ranked Matches. For that reason, it's important to take full advantage of the 3v3 aspect of the game, surely you don't wanna get erased by a coordinated team made up of Strike Kirishima, Strike Kendo and Cementoss/Ibara/Izuku OFA, don't you?

# The Basics
If you've been playing the game for a while, you probably can skip to the next bit, as this bit is for basic teamwork signals and "etiquette".

- Land with your teammates, especially if they have low mobility or can revive you. Sometimes you can get away with some spacing if you or your teammates have fast mobility, but staying together is important to be able to fence off threats and not die while ambushed alone. Characters like Kurogiri are one of the few exceptions that can spawn on the opposite site with no trouble, as Kurogiri can retrieve DOWNd teammates from anywhere on the map. For more experienced and coordinated teams, splitting can work, especially when splitting to get loot more easily or to optimize non-Kota Finder Kota rescue, however this can easily backfire when playing with random teammates or even with friends if they are caught lacking.
- If your teammate uses the "I Need Recovery Items" notification and they're using it on a teamheal, it means they're drinking a teamheal, so in this case you should try to delay your wake-ups if you're low on health so you can buy yourself time to be healed. If you're gonna use a teamheal, notify your team. In some cases it might be best to not do it if you feel you might get interrupted at any moment, or else your teammates might not get the healing they expected, possibly getting them killed.
- Boxes and Gold Boxes are not to be shared. Do not attempt to pick the loot of a Normal or Gold Box your teammate has opened, the only shared loot are Large Item Boxes and KOd enemies, use your gut to tell how much loot you can take from these, especially if you have high levels but your teammates are struggling.
- Using "I need recovery items" on non-teamheals means they actually ran out of that specific drink and need more. If you can spare some, do it, otherwise it's okay if you don't. Using it on Team Enhancement Kits either means "Hey, you forgot to drink it" or "Hey, where's Kota?" if one of your teammates (or yourself) have Kota Finder equiped.
- If you see an ability card that matches the class/role of a teammate and it also matches a skill they don't have at level 9, ping it to them so they can level up. If possible leave it close to their position, since many people don't like to run back at where you left the card if there's enough distance. If you need one of these cards (and they dont match your own class) and don't want to give it to your teammates because of how useful it can be to you, then at least try to only keep the ones for your teammate's least useful ability. For example, Mr. Compress' least useful ability is Beta, so if you want to keep Support Ability Cards to heal yourself, keep beta ones and leave the alpha and gamma ones to your Compress teammate.
- If a teammate dies, go get their badge, nobody wants to be waiting the whole match doing nothing when their teammates have all the tools to revive them. However, this tip should also be taken carefully, if it's overly risky then you can leave it behind (but this only really applies in the late game or if you have very little HP drinks), but keep in mind that even when it feels difficult to retrieve the badge, you should still do it so long as you don't think you will die, simply having a badge deep into the Poison Mist isn't a death sentence in of itself. Do your best to also get revive cards, either by helping civilians, or by scouting for the loot of dead bodies, it can be really frustrating when teammates fight but pay no attention to loot that could contain full revive cards or at the very least gray ones.
- If you're gonna pick fights, you can try to pick them against people attacking your team, that way you have a target to attack while also having allies that won't attack you and will take the aggro fully or partially.
- If you have your good skills at level 9 and your only ability not maxed is pretty unimportant (Tsuyu Asui's gamma skill, Compress beta skill, etc...), consider handing the Level Up cards to teammates, if they perform better, that will work out nicely for you.
- This is more advanced, but try to not interrupt your teammates' combos, this applies especially with characters like Aizawa, who might try to pull the enemy with an alpha but a teammate might interrupt this with a lower DMG skill.
- If you have 1 revive card and your teammate has 2 (or viceversa) and the other teammate is dead, one of you should give the cards to the other to perform the revive, some people forget they don't need to collect 3 by themselves, they can rely on ally revive cards too.
- Interrupting an enemy attacking your teammate can give them room to heal and come back to battle while giving you a target to fight.

# Building a Team

Every character in this game has a class/role, assigned by the developers: Strike, Assault, Rapid, Support and Technical, but you probably already know this from the Class Guide. Aside from the official classification, there’s a distinct set of archetypes that tells you about their roles in a match. My Hero Ultra Rumble is a game that does not force you into picking characters from each role or archetype, but understanding them is crucial to get a better sense of your team. Let's introduce these archetypes:

## Duelists

Duelists are characters with high mobility and stun potential. Their main objective is to isolate their opponent from their team and win them in 1v1. They tend to chase their victims, even if it means they will get separated from their teammates. Characters of this archetype often lack sustainability, they are usually the first to get into a fight, but the first one to flee.

Duelists are useful to secure a team wipeout. Most of the players will try to run after losing a teamfight, and duelists prevent them from escaping and resurrecting their teams.

## Frontliners

Frontliners thrive in chaos. They usually participate in dangerous mass fights. They usually have a bigger HP pool and AoE abilities with decent mobility. They tend to stay closer to their team, but sometimes will leave it and search for engagement. 

Frontliners the biggest archetype in the game. They usually present a middle ground between survivability, damage and mobility. They are generally strong and self-sufficient.

</div>

## Backliners

Another archetype of Ultra Rumble are backliners. This is the definition of a glass gun. They can deal significant damage, but fold too quickly if they are getting focused, that’s why they rely on their team for protection.

</div>

## Roomsiders

Roomsiders usually try to stay closer to buildings and hide behind the map obstacles. Their main adjective is protecting areas they occupied.

The strong side of roomsiders is that they can make certain areas practically off-limits for their enemies, creating a safe spot for their teams to regroup and heal. They are especially useful in late circles, where they can occupy a strategically valuable place and hold it for a long time, forcing their enemies to fight in the open. Sometimes Frontliners like Endeavor or Strike Todoroki can be roomsiders too.
The weak side of this archetype is that they are not roomsiders by choice. All those characters want to be Frontliners, but they lack much needed mobility and may be picked off in the open too quickly.
