# <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">TEAMWORK: The Key to Success</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about Teamwork, the biggest fear of the average Ultra Rumble player!

# Introduction: The Power of Friendship
Teamwork is a crucial part of the game, even really powerful and experienced players can easily die without teamwork, but when the team is actually coordinated and actually follow some strategies, they can be absolutely terrifying and almost invincible in normal Ranked Matches. For that reason, it's important to take full advantage of the 3v3 aspect of the game, surely you don't wanna get erased by a coordinated team made up of Strike Kirishima, Strike Kendo and Cementoss/Ibara/Izuku OFA, don't you?

# The Basics
If you've been playing the game for a while, you probably can skip to the next bit, as this bit is for basic teamwork signals and "etiquette".

- Land with your teammates, especially if they have low mobility or can revive you. Sometimes you can get away with some spacing if you or your teammates have fast mobility, but staying together is important to be able to fence off threats and not die while ambushed alone. Characters like Kurogiri are one of the few exceptions that can spawn on the opposite site with no trouble, as Kurogiri can retrieve DOWNd teammates from anywhere on the map. For more experienced and coordinated teams, splitting can work, especially when splitting to get loot more easily or to optimize non-Kota Finder Kota rescue, however this can easily backfire when playing with random teammates or even with friends if they are caught lacking.
- If your teammate uses the "I Need Recovery Items" notification and they're using it on a teamheal, it means they're drinking a teamheal, so in this case you should try to delay your wake-ups if you're low on health so you can buy yourself time to be healed. If you're gonna use a teamheal, notify your team. In some cases it might be best to not do it if you feel you might get interrupted at any moment, or else your teammates might not get the healing they expected, possibly getting them killed.
- Boxes and Gold Boxes are not to be shared. Do not attempt to pick the loot of a Normal or Gold Box your teammate has opened, the only shared loot are Large Item Boxes and KOd enemies, use your gut to tell how much loot you can take from these, especially if you have high levels but your teammates are struggling.
- Using "I need recovery items" on non-teamheals means they actually ran out of that specific drink and need more. If you can spare some, do it, otherwise it's okay if you don't. Using it on Team Enhancement Kits either means "Hey, you forgot to drink it" or "Hey, where's Kota?" if one of your teammates (or yourself) have Kota Finder equiped.
- If you see an ability card that matches the class/role of a teammate and it also matches a skill they don't have at level 9, ping it to them so they can level up. If possible leave it close to their position, since many people don't like to run back at where you left the card if there's enough distance. If you need one of these cards (and they dont match your own class) and don't want to give it to your teammates because of how useful it can be to you, then at least try to only keep the ones for your teammate's least useful ability. For example, Mr. Compress' least useful ability is Beta, so if you want to keep Support Ability Cards to heal yourself, keep beta ones and leave the alpha and gamma ones to your Compress teammate.
- If a teammate dies, go get their badge, nobody wants to be waiting the whole match doing nothing when their teammates have all the tools to revive them. However, this tip should also be taken carefully, if it's overly risky then you can leave it behind (but this only really applies in the late game or if you have very little HP drinks), but keep in mind that even when it feels difficult to retrieve the badge, you should still do it so long as you don't think you will die, simply having a badge deep into the Poison Mist isn't a death sentence in of itself. Do your best to also get revive cards, either by helping civilians, or by scouting for the loot of dead bodies, it can be really frustrating when teammates fight but pay no attention to loot that could contain full revive cards or at the very least gray ones.
- If you're gonna pick fights, you can try to pick them against people attacking your team, that way you have a target to attack while also having allies that won't attack you and will take the aggro fully or partially.
- If you have your good skills at level 9 and your only ability not maxed is pretty unimportant (Tsuyu Asui's gamma skill, Compress beta skill, etc...), consider handing the Level Up cards to teammates, if they perform better, that will work out nicely for you.
- This is more advanced, but try to not interrupt your teammates' combos, this applies especially with characters like Aizawa, who might try to pull the enemy with an alpha but a teammate might interrupt this with a lower DMG skill.
- If you have 1 revive card and your teammate has 2 (or viceversa) and the other teammate is dead, one of you should give the cards to the other to perform the revive, some people forget they don't need to collect 3 by themselves, they can rely on ally revive cards too.
- Interrupting an enemy attacking your teammate can give them room to heal and come back to battle while giving you a target to fight.


# Types of Escape

Escaping isn't about being fast or creating distance, it's about making the enemy(s) targetting you stop doing so, and there are a few ways of achieving this:

## Fleeing - The Most Basic Kind of Escape

This is what most players do on instinct, and it's probably the safest method to escape an enemy if done properly. Fleeing isn't just about running as far as you can, it's also about confusing the enemy.<br><br>

The most basic type of Fleeing is escaping the enemy in a way it creates the most distance between you two. This works well early-game if you're a fast character, or if you have vertical mobility to get on top of a tall place but your enemy doesn't have that level of mobility, but for slower characters or against enemies that can either move fast, attack from long range, or like to chase a lot, this can be pretty ineffective. Furthermore, this can stray you away from your team for a noticeable amount of time, which is really not ideal.

A better approach for fleeing is to confuse the enemy by getting inside a complex building or structure and enter/leave it from different entrances until your enemy doesn't know where you are anymore. In this approach, you are often cutting line of sight and move a lot of distance but within a specific area, meaning that the distance you got away from your team is smaller, and even people who really want to chase you might not be able to do it, as they won't know exactly where you went, but be careful with drinking healing items or using skills, as both make noise. An easy way to quickly confuse an enemy and hinder their chase is to quickly run behind a building and run up the building with either a Rapid Ability Card or the Wall Runner special tuning, this often comes handy since you can use the building as barrier to not get attacked, and enemies sometimes can't tell you ran up a wall, believing you just kept running straight.

Another thing you can do if the enemy is chasing you very closely is to flee to the top of a tall building and drop from there, but then quickly use a mobility skill to go back up. This is done to bait the enemy into dropping too so you can just flee the opposite direction and confuse them further. Alternatively, you can drop from a building and quickly attach yourself to the wall, making them think you kept going when in reality you're stealthly clinging to a wall they jumped past.

Wall Running (from Rapid Ability Cards and the Wall Runner special tuning) can make a lot of difference when it comes to escaping, both when it comes to playing low mobility characters and for high mobility ones, as wall running gives you a high boost in agility. For more information on Wall Running and its techs check out the wall run sub-guide.

## Enclosing

Enclosing is a type of "escape" that can either be safe or be your doom. Consisting in trapping yourself in a room with structures produced by your skills, this escape works best in the endgame, especially crowded ones, where people don't have much time to spend on you or else another team will come attack them. The danger of this is obvious, you're trapping yourself in a small area, which makes you extremely vulnerable to attacks that go through walls like Strike Shigaraki's beta skill or Technical Shigaraki's alpha skill, but in the right scenario it can give you enough time to heal, revive teammates, or even break aggro.

This type of escape is most commonly seen in both Shoto Todorokis, occassionally Cementoss, Momo, and in rare cases Strike Izuku Midoriya or Assault Ochaco Uraraka.

A variation of Enclosing can be performed by characters like Momo Yaoyorozu, in which they can fill a room with deadly abilities or traps which enemies can theoretically walk into, but will get heavily punished by doing so, and might deter wiser players from engaging.

## Kiting and Baiting

Arguably a variation of "Fleeing", this consists in attacking your enemy while fleeing away, to discourage them from following you both with distance and with damage. Characters like Rapid Katsuki Bakugo and Rapid Hawks can do this by sheer nature, as they can either gain mobility by attacking you, or can flee while fighting back without losing any speed. A character that is often seen doing this is Overhaul, since landing a gamma skill can stun the enemies, buying him time.

Another option is baiting, if you run away from the enemy but they always manage to be really close to you, you can turn around for a second and throw an attack right before they turn around a corner or entrance to hit them without being hit back instantly. This works better with skills with knockback or knockdown, as they can't attack immediately after, buying you at least a second to keep running or cut line of sight.

## Air Stalling

Some characters can stay high up in the sky for long periods of time, such as Strike Denki Kaminari, Technical Tomura Shigaraki, Kurogiri, both Hawks and more. This works best in the endgame, as in the early game the enemy can just wait for you to come down, while in the endgame other teams can attack the enemy, taking the aggro for you. This is what most people do when attempting to heal but finding no place to do so.

## Leading The Enemy to Another Enemy Team

I need a description for this one

## Mistscape

A strong option to remove aggro from yourself is to go seek refuge in the Poison Mist. This mostly works in the midgame, lategame or endgame. Trying this during the early game can often be a bad idea, especially against more experienced players. Many people prefer to avoid going into the Poison Mist, so if you've learnt to feel the mist, you can use this to your advantage. If you did not feel the mist yet, check the Poison Mist sub-guide.
