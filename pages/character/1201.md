All Might (Gatling) is a rapid/strike/support hybrid character that can fight at close, medium,  and long distances. He is a walking tank when his alpha is fully ramped up and can revive his teamates with his special action and turn the tide of battle.

As one of the bigger characters in the game that plays an event  bigger role to their team you will often find yourself being focused alot, but that's not to much of a problem because of your insanely high close and far ranged damage. Combined with the fact of having multiple movement options you can truly dominate the battlefield.

## Alpha Skill - Taxes Smash Gatling
<p align="center">

</p>

All Might begins punching the air, creating miniature shockwaves that damage opponents and pierce through multiple foes. As All Might continues punching his alphas begin firing out faster and faster until he is punching you at Mach 5. 

This move is like no other because it has a progressive wind up that only happens when using the move itself, not like moves like AFO Charged Alpha where you merely hold the button and release it to get the empowered version. 

This move also has one fatal flaw: Vunerablility. All Might has armor during this move, however that can be more of a downside than an upside. Because of said armor he is less prone to being blown away by moves which means as long as you’re punching you’re gonna be dying a lot faster if someone’s shooting at you. 

One neat thing about this move though is that All Might can use this in conjuction with his melee string in a technique called “Rapid-Gatling”, where All Might uses his melee and cancels into his alpha during the bit where he begins rapid punching. This makes it to where you can get max speed punches instantly without having to do the windup. 

Damage for this move per shot is terrible, since he can only do about 30 something per shot at max, however the rate at which he fires them makes it to where he can dish out incredible amounts of damage with relative ease.

A common mistake beginning Rapid Might players do is use this move up close. This is not a move you want people seeing you do. They will shoot at you and you will die. You want to be coming into a fight doing this from a distance so it takes time for people to see you and it gives you time to dish out ridiculous amounts of damage while they are confused and scared.
Also it’s good to use this move to finish off opponents incredibly fast.

All Might does a crosschop that launches an air shockwave that pushes back the opponent while being capable of hitting multiple targets by piercing through them. Hold the button for All Might to charge forward in one direction ending it with a crosschop.

It's a pretty simple move that gives All Might his rapid movements while also being one of his main sources of attack, it's specially good thanks to the projectile version having a DP of 250 meaning you can do two to fully knock the enemy.

The projectile version's collision hitbox is smaller than its damage hitbox, which means that you can hit opponents hiding behind a corner or a wall, as the sides of the projectile don't have collisions so it can squeeze its way in small spaces.

The hold version is slightly more complex (and also slightly buggy due to the charge forward some times dropping before the follow up) the ending part has just as much DP as the tap version however the charge forward has a DP value of 50 itself which can add up, to add to this it's one of the few rapid movement skills CAPABLE of reloading after using it midair, not requiring to touch the ground. It is capable of being cancelled before the ending into another beta meaning you can keep going while also being able to fly in a zigzag. This version however doesn't allow for any follow-up after.*<br>
<br>
When using it to escape, use the skill again before All Might does the final slash, since the final slash slows you down.

</p>

In conclusion probably the best move on his kit due to how versatile it is and thanks to it's pretty good cooldowns.
*(Certain tunes like Electrification if triggered allow you to follow up with all moves except for a charged beta as it will max out the DP before connected the slash)

## Gamma Skill - Arizona Smash

All might gets into a leaping stance and grabs his opponent, leaping up into the air and slams his opponents down for massive damage (one of the highest in the game for a single-instance move) and dealing the same amount of damage to enemies inside the move's AoE. You can also displace the grabbed target by moving before you finish the move, which you can use to move them closer/farther away from your teammates, move the enemy into the Poison Mist, or just to make sure you land the move on another enemy/enemies too. 

The initial start up of this move has no armor but if it connects the follow-up leap will have armor all until he slams his opponent.

The grab part of this move has 0 down power (DP) but the slam is an insta 500 which is a hard knockdown.

A little known fact about this move when using it in the air compared to the ground is that it has better tracking and farther range.

This move is also a command grab so you can cancel most moves in the game even armored ones, however the move comes out decently slow and loses priority to most moves in the game.

## Special Action #1 - High Jump
<p align="center">

</p>
All Might's jump special action is a mobility tool with decent start up time, once the startup has finish you will leap high in the air with free movement control, while in the air you can also use your alpha without canceling momentum, it helps quite alot since he can get full charge before he gets to the ground, and have an easier time hitting opponents due to the height advantage he gains. Using this ability with Ochaco Uraraka's special action will temporarily grant you infinite flight. Using this special action will fully consume your special action gauge.

## Special Action #2 - Carry to Safety

</p>
All Might's other special action is a revive that is shared with both base dekus and lida. When close to a DOWNd teamate you gain the option to pick them up, while carrying the downed teamate you get armor and a speed boost until you either drop them or are knocked out of it.

The special action runs on the special action meter, that passively goes down when carrying a teamate, but it's not consumed upon reviving your teammate by putting them down. Careful when using this ability as you might accidentally use his jump special action if you aren't properly looking at your ally or close enough.
