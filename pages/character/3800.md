*The elusive magician puts on an enchanting show and pickpockets with precision.*

Mr. Compress is an expert in both offense and defense, being an excellent damage dealer and supporting teammates, as well as using his high mobility to sneak up on opponents or escape tense situations. Use his Alpha to burst down opponents, his Beta to block moves aimed at you or teammates, and his Gamma to chase, flee, loot, move allies or reposition. A character that loves sticking around areas with plenty of verticality where he can easily change his elevation and mask his location, but must be very wary of close-quarter brawls.

## Alpha Skill - Production Magic

<p align="center">

</p>

Mr. Compress’ Alpha is his best move by far and his most reliable source of damage. It consists of 3 main components: the initial marble he throws, the object that comes out  and the shockwave once it lands.

### The Marble
The marble has a few unique properties. For starters, no matter the level of your Alpha, a direct hit with the marble will always deal 5 damage (although you will often see 75 instead because the 2nd part of his alpha will also hit), a fairly insignificant amount but it starts to pile up once it gets combined with the other parts of the Alpha. On top of this extra damage, hitting an opponent who has GP will cause them to be stunned in place, allowing you to follow up with more alphas as the opponent won't be able to move. This aspect of his Alpha, alongside its decently low downpower, turns Compress in a GP destroying machine, very hard to counteract once you’re stunned. 

The marble also travels in a different way from any other projectile currently in the game; after throwing the marble, instead of going straight forward like a generic projectile, it will actually travel on an arc. On top of that, if the marble hits a wall or the floor it will bounce off instead of dissapearing. It's very much worth noting however that both of these properties change when you enter Aim Mode: the arc/angle at which Compress throws the marble is much different, allowinging it to travel farther distances and slowing the spawning of the object inside the marble. Most importantly, because of both of these variations, in Aim Mode, bouncing the marble off of objects or a wall to hit enemies is much easier.

</p>

### The Object

These items include the barrel at levels 1-3, the boulder at 4-6, and the truck at 7-9, each being bigger than the previous (Trucks are especially excellent at hitting enemies standing too close to the edge of a corner, like doorways for example, thanks to this expanded size and hitbox). This part of the Alpha is the move that deals most of the damage when playing Compress. Do try to always keep one alpha in your pocket, as the penalty reload is much longer than the individual charges returning. What you will need to be careful with is his downpower when in combination with teammates. Opponents getting hit by multiple moves at once alongside Compress' alpha will be knocked down much quicker, meaning sometimes it may be better for you to throw fewer Alphas if your teammates can deal more damage with their own moves. This will also apply to opponents being hit by the moves of other opponents.

</p>

### The Shockwave

The shockwave from Compress’ alpha comes out from the released object when it hits the ground, with its size and damage being dictated by level just like with the object itself. There’s really nothing special about the shockwave, aside from the fact it expands the range at which you can hit enemies not currently in your line of sight.
With that being said, the changes to DP have effected the shockwave. Due to its DP being increased to 50 alongside the main Alpha object, landing both that and the shockwave can mean knocking opponents over much faster than usual. While some characters don't mind knocking opponents down to force wake-up catches, Compress does not like these kind of situations. As such, in some cases it may be advantageous to purposely make sure the shockwave portion of the alpha misses your opponent so that they stay standing longer. This allows both you and teammates to attack enemies for longer than if the shockwave had caused them to be knocked down faster. Do keep in mind however that if you have teammates who possibly do like attempting wake-up catches, it may be worth still hitting the shockwave as long as they're with you. Hitting all 3 parts of Compress's alpha is also much easier when attacking from above, as normally at ground level the shockwave goes past the target you've hit with the marble, while if you hit them from above you can avoid this.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand

</p>

Compress’ Beta Skill is a barrier that can stop projectiles from hurting him or allies.
When a projectile hits this barrier, Compress will quickly compress it and reflect it back, dealing some extra damage the original projectile didn't have. 

Different Moves can have 3 types of interactions with Compress' Beta: Reflect, Block and Ignore.

</p>

**Reflectable Moves**

Reflectable moves are attacks that upon hitting Compress's shield will be sent back to the enemy, dealing increased damage. Usually, projectiles are reflectable, while melee attacks are usually not reflectable. Reflected moves are not guaranteed to hit the target, especially if they're moving quickly. For a list of reflectable moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

</p>

**Blockable Moves**

Blockable moves are attacks that upon hitting Compress's shield will vanish, but won't be reflected back to the original user. While these won't do damage to the enemy, it will also cause no damage to you. For a list of blockable moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/MrB2.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Ignored Moves**

Ignored moves are attacks that do not interact with Compress's shield, hence, they will ignore it and damage him. Moves in this category are often shockwaves, physical attacks, or area attacks that might also hit Compress from behind. For a list of ignored moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

</p>

Beta is Compress’ most defensive tool, able to block all sorts of damage as you can see above. This has a variety of uses, the most obvious of which is to use it mid shoot off to reflect alphas at trigger happy opponents. Swapping back and forth between this and your alpha conserves your own health and can often force enemies into engaging with you close up so you can start Melee combos. This move is percentage based, meaning you can hold it up as much as you want, but the more hits it absorves the more percentage gets consumed until it's forced into reload. A helpful tip is that this move can be rolled to avoid the EndLag of deactivating it.
However this isn't the only way to use your Beta; other uses consist in leaning into Compress’ Support role by protecting. teammates from taking damage too. Stand in front of allies opening boxes, supply drops or even finishing enemies to stop your opponents from interrupting your team. Even standing in front of an ally while they have a shoot off, essentially making them invincible while the fight is happening. Beta is widely considered one of the worst moves in the game, so show everyone just how useful (or annoying) it can actually be.

## Gamma Skill - Magician's Choice
<p align="center">

</p>

Mr. Compress' Gamma is all about movement. With this move, he compresses himself into a marble and performs a high leap into the air, leaving a cloud of smoke behind. This Skill can be used to reposition, run away, chase enemies, gain height, dodge attacks, truly a jack of all trades when it comes to mobility. Not only that, but when levelling this skill to level 9 you will gain a second charge, giving it even more potential uses.

You need to be careful when you use it, as due to its slow recharge time being caught without it can sometimes be a death sentence or the reason an opponent escapes. For this reason using the Gamma offensively is for the most part a fairly unwise decision when playing Compress, especially early game before you have the levels for a quicker recharge. If you do use it offensively, it's best done when you already have the second charge you get with level 9 or when you can guarantee it will do damage, such as using it to end a combo. You could also use it to catch the wake up of people who mash and don’t use their i-frames, as the explosion at higher levels has a decent size and damage.
One of the main reasons that make this move good is that Compress will gain Hyper Armor while doing his animation, allowing him to almost always at least enter his marble and drop his bomb on wake up catches or start his flight while running away. Some things to keep in mind are that Hyper Armor doesn't stop damage at all, it will just avoid getting knock downed, and that you do NOT have armor while in the marble itself and can be knocked out of it, essentially wasting your charge. Some moves can also hit through the move's armor and knock you down regardless.

## Special Action - Magic Resurrection
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch038.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Compress' Special Action lets him compress and pocket an ally at any time, as long as he is close to them. If the ally was alive when pocketed, they will stay in the pocket and regain health (HP) slowly (they can break out of the pocket at any time by pressing any attack button). If the ally was downed, Compress will still pick them up but they won't get healed over time, instead they'll get revived once uncompressed.

Now, the most clear and obvious use of this is to pick up a downed teammate in order to revive them, but this might not be the best idea in every situation. As weird as it might sound, sometimes you need to let your allies die. If, for example, a Strike Shigaraki and an All Might are both spamming Alpha on your downed teammate, not only will you probably not make it in time to save them, but you might also get killed yourself. Now this isn't to say never rescue your teammates, but just be aware of who’s around and what situation both you and your downed teammate are in before committing to the rescue. Additionally, if you do manage to pick up a downed teammate, keep in mind you don't always need to teleport away with Gamma; sometimes just walking behind cover is more than enough if the focus is elsewhere and so you don't leave your third teammate fighting alone while you're coming back from teleporting away. A lot of times picking someone up just to drop them immediately works, especially if they have their own mobility, as it means you can stay in the action to help your other teammate once more while they run and heal. This is especially good in final circles where you can’t guarantee there will even be anywhere safe to bring them if you try to Gamma away. A neat little trick you can actually do when you're the one being carried by Compress is pressing the Jump or Attack button once your time reaches zero to instantly revive yourself without needing to go through the uncompressing animation. Compress' Special Action isn't just useful for downed teammates, though.

Carrying non-downed teammates can be practical: being able to carry non-mobile teammates long distance or even high mobility ones to save them from wasting their own abilities. You can use this to enter fights, traverse buildings/terrain, or even help someone escape before they go down, all while slowly regaining HP. The main advantage of this is potential heal-offs in final circles. Although not a common way for games to end, if it comes down to it, Compress can put a teammate in his pocket to not only passively heal storm damage, but also prevent storm damage affecting them whatsoever, in most situations essentially guaranteeing a win. Using it in this way is better when you can communicate with your team directly so they know why you want to pick them up, but don’t hesitate to try it with randoms either if they cooperate.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 2-string combo, Compress’ Ground Melee consists of 2 different hits before knocking down the opponent. With the first hit Compress will strike the enemy with his cane in a sideways motion. This is the part of Compress’ Melee you'll be using the most. For the second hit, he spins his cane in his hand hitting the opponent multiple times and causing them to be knocked down. It's used as a combo ender. Compress’ first Melee hit can be chained into itself a maximum of 5 times before knocking over an opponent. For this reason, it's best to hit 4 in a row and then knock over with the second hit for max damage. It's important to note that compared to many other Melees, Compress’s is actually quite slow due to him reeling back the cane before his first strike. This often means that in situations where you and the enemy both go for a Melee, Compress will often be the one getting hit and allowing your opponent to start potential combos. If you're not fast enough, it can also result in your Melee chains being broken via the enemy's melee (or roll).

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Compress' Air Melee is an uppercut with the cane, knocking opponents into the air. Used as a combo starter or tool to quickly knock back nearby opponents. 
Best used when dropping in from above, such as when falling from highground or from a Gamma teleport as the momentum allows you to combo into more Melees easier.

## Leveling Paths
### Standard Path
This is the level up path on Mr. Compress. It's by far his best option and there really isn't any other that comes close to it. Getting your Alpha to level 7 is to get your item size to Trucks as fast as possible. This allows Compress to deal much more consistent damage with his bigger Alpha and rely less on aim than with his smaller projectiles. Because Compress struggles to deal consistent damage early on, this is the best way to support your team and yourself through early engagements. Gamma to 9 afterward is to make sure you have Compress’ best movement option available, as he doesn't get the second charge of his Gamma until level 9. This allows you to chase, run and move around much faster and over greater distances. Alpha to level 9 after is for the extra charge you get at the final level and for increased damage. Beta can wait until the end as the size and ammo increases it gets are rarely needed, and the increased reflection damage, while nice, should be secondary to your movement and primary source of damage. If you want you can delay leveling your Beta even longer and instead give level up cards to your team once your Alpha and Gamma are both maxed.

</p>

### Escape Path
This level up path can be used when you spawn in and absolutely nobody is around for you to fight. This would mean that you realistically shouldn't need to level up your Alpha right away, and can instead focus on your movement for faster looting. The version in which you level Alpha to 4 is precautionary just in case people end up coming to your area regardless. It can also be used when you are having a particularly bad time looting, such as suffering an early death, to just simply get your movement online to ensure you don’t go down again. While this has the potential to be an okay alternative to the main path, you don’t particularly need 2 Gammas to loot fast on Compress, and in the event a team does rotate to your general location, having your level 7 Alpha is just so good for consistency. This could work for players who can already confidently hit Alphas regardless of size, and don’t necessarily need the extra size provided by the truck projectile. This path could also work for a more supportive style of play on Compress, allowing you to both get to civilians faster, and quickly move in and out of fights to use team heals when your allies find themselves in a bad spot. Alternatively, you could also use this in unranked games to practice your aim with lower level versions of the Alpha. Beta is levelled last for the same reason as before.

### Escape Path: Cautious Ver.
A variation of the previous path in which you level Alpha to 4 as a precautionary measure just in case people end up coming to your area regardless.

## Techs
Mr. Compress has 3 special behaviors that you can learn to enhance your gameplay.
### Air Extension
After using gamma, you can spam the melee button to perform air melees. This will allow you to fall a bit slower, allowing you to traverse a greater distance or stall in the air for a longer amount of time.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 2 Cancelling
By inputting a melee attack while not holding a direction, waiting until the last moment to use his melee's second hit and then inputting a direction (backwards is best) you can cancel the animation of his cane spinning and start moving again immediately. This can be fully chained a total of 3 times, before knocking down the enemy on the fourth hit of your first melee, meaning ideally you want to let the cane spin finish after the third chain. This can also be done with Compress’ air melee by waiting until you’ve almost touched the ground, using air melee, and then holding forward, allowing for up to 2 extra air melees to come out. Unfortunately hitting the first 2 will hard knockdown an opponent, rendering the potential third useless.<br>
<br>
The input would be: Melee 1 (No Direction Key pressed) -> Wait (The delay you gotta wait might make you hit a 2nd Melee 1, but this is bad, you gotta wait a decent bit but not enough to trigger a 2nd Melee 1 instead of a Melee 2) -> Melee 2 -> Movement Key (preferrably back, with tiny delay to avoid cancelling Melee 2 too soon)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma Cancelling
This tech allows Mr. Compress to exit his Gamma early in some situations. By standing a small distance away from a ledge, and aiming down to about your waist level, Compress will exit his marble and briefly perform the start of the exit animation midair while also losing all of his momentum. This likely happens as the game sees Compress’ marble nearly hitting the ledge as him landing, and as such it boots you out prematurely. The biggest problem with this tech is that it is scarcely, if ever, actually a useful thing to perform. It's quite hard to imagine a situation where it isn’t much more time and cost effective to simply jump or even run off of whatever building you're on rather than wasting a charge of your Gamma. In very niche situations it may confuse chasing opponents who expect you to teleport far away thanks to the smoke cloud hiding you, but if you're caught you've very likely screwed yourself. If this is ever changed to possibly not remove Compress’ momentum it may become more niche, but until that day you’re likely better off avoiding it.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Mr. Compress's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: ? DP (Marble), 50 DP (Object), 50 DP (Shockwave)<br>
Beta Skill: - DP<br>
Gamma Skill: ? DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2: ? DP (Individually), ? DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: ? DP<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A basic combo that most characters have, using Air Melee as combo starter and chain it into a ground melee chain.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Melee -> Alpha -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A more optimized version of the previous combo adding an alpha for extra damage, though the alpha only works if the hit is on GP.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A classic Melee 1 spam chain that keeps the enemy locked in place for a while. This combo only works on HP, as Compress's melee is too slow for GP stun's quick recovery.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800c8-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A more complex melee chain that makes use of Melee 2 Cancel for combo extension.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800c3-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha
Mr. Compress's signature combo that everyone knows. It takes advantage of the marble's stun property on enemies with GP to deliver free damage. This combo breaks GP and doesn't work on HP.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800c5-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
An extension of the previous combo making use of the extra Downpower available to sneak in some melees for higher damage. This combo can also be executed by using Melee 1 as the combo starter and then skip one of the two Melee 1 that go after the four alphas. This combo is quite long, so feel free to interrupt it in a heated battle.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Gamma
A combo that makes use of the Alpha x4 combo plus the Melee 2 Cancel tech. While this combo is his strongest one, the true combo ends in Melee 2 Cancel, as the gamma isn't a "true combo". Since it's a long combo, you may want to interrupt it mid-execution if you're not in a 1v1.

</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Jump -> Alpha -> Air Melee -> Alpha
A varied combo that uses a lot of different moves. The first alpha must be on GP for the combo to work.

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Strike Slots: Alpha DMG > HP DMG > GP DMG > Melee DMG > Gamma DMG > Beta DMG**</a><br>
Alpha is Compress's primary damage source so it needs as much attack boost as possible. Compress can struggle against opponents with HP, so HP attack gives you a better chance to knock opponents you can’t stun. GP attack power is honestly just used as another Alpha attack power boost. Compress’ melee is quite important in a lot of his combos and for forcing people off you in close quarters so Melee attack is mostly for boosting combo damage. Gamma isn’t really something you want to attack with, but can be used to end combos or catch wake ups, so Gamma attack is for those scenarios. Your Beta already boosts the attack power of moves it reflects meaning you really don’t need Beta attack at all.

<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Assault Slots: [GP Defense >] HP Defense > Beta Defense > Gamma Defense > Alpha Defense > Melee Defense**</a><br>
GP defense isn't currently available to use but it is in the game files, and will definitely be the best when it comes out due to how often you replenish your GP. HP defense is the only kind of defense that currently provides use against every kind of hit, making it the best. Across the roster Beta’s tend to be the highest damaging moves, making defense against Beta good. A smaller number of characters have the previous point applied to their Gamma instead, making it the next best. While Compress’ Beta is a built-in Alpha counter, there are some characters who Alphas can bypass your Beta, and sometimes you may find yourself getting hit when your Beta is down. Alpha defense would be for those situations. Melee defense is just sort of the worst one thanks to Melees having a low effective range and because they don’t hit for tons when compared to regular quirks. This should not be a priority defense to get.

<a style="color: cyan !important;">**Rapid Slots: -**</a><br>

<a style="color: lime !important;">**Support Slots: HP+ = GP+ >>>> Down HP+ >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Run Speed+**</a><br>
HP and GP up both accomplish similar things. While you’ll likely get more use out of GP up since you restore GP more frequently, HP is good for surviving in the Poison Mist longer and against attacks that directly target your HP. GP is likely the better option on Compress, but both are beneficial, so it's up to you to decide what you prefer. Max down HP is pretty bad as you only benefit once you've already lost, and theoretically you wouldn’t even get value from it if you had the extra GP or HP from a different Support slot option. It can very rarely help you get revived if you aren't thirsted in two seconds or if you go down in the Poison Mist and need to survive a bit longer to get out or outlive another downed player. Run speed up sucks and should only be used on budget builds or costumes you want to test Special TUNINGS on so you don't waste better character data.

<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">**Technical Slots: Gamma Reload > Alpha Reload > PU/PC Reload > Beta Reload > Special Action Reload**</a><br>
Gamma is Compress’s lifeblood in a game, it's how he escapes, chases, rescues, everything. Getting this back faster should always be a priority. Alpha reload is next because it's his main damage source so getting it quick is really good, especially if you ever run out of charges and need to wait out the penalty reload. PU/ PC reload is next because you never know when that couple extra percent could save your life, and because the last two reloads aren't good on him. To actually run out of ammo for your Beta takes a ridiculous amount of blocking and even at low levels it very rarely runs out of charge so you don’t need this. Special Action reload is useless on Compress because his Special Action has about a 1 second reload.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>With how easily Compress is able to break GP, activating this Tuning shouldn’t be an issue. The increased speed at which you get both your Gammas and Alphas back will make fighting, running, and chasing much easier to do consistently. Essentially this functions as a better ‘Revenge Tech,’ as you don’t need to lose GP to get the same benefit.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Gives Compress highground for free without the need to use his Gamma. Also gives you an additional option on wake up by jumping before you Gamma. Makes spamming Alphas from above even easier, and makes landing the shockwave more reliable. Gets you above certain moves that are otherwise problematic. |
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>Makes you invincible every time your GP breaks, stopping combos or giving you an opportunity to disengage. At higher levels you can use a small GP or HP drink to heal before permeation ends, or if you aren’t knocked over a large GP drink if you time it well. Attacking will end the permeation early.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>Getting a movement speed boost for landing a melee is incredible with the movement system changes. Allows your Gamma to become even better for movement, and makes your Alpha, Gamma, and melee come out quicker than before, making Compress much more threatening.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>Gives you an opportunity to escape or keep fighting when you would have otherwise gone DOWN. It almost functions like a second life.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch026_00.png" width="125"> | **Ability Manifest** <br>Functions similarly to the ‘Revenge’ Special Tunings all wrapped into one. It will be reliant on what Quirk Skill cards you can find however, and what level they’re at for it to function at its highest potential. Best used with Tech cards, but is good with the others as well.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Great for increasing your Alpha damage even more. Great when used in tandem with other attack increasing Tuning like Embrittlement or Revenge Strike to make your damage potential even higher. Works best on outfits like Disguise: Sweater (Dangerous) and Cyberpunk (Dangerous).|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>Very useful since Compress is a level dependent character. He can get in and out of areas with a large box quickly thanks to his Gamma. Also gets you a full team heal and a revive card for support play. Not advised to drop on the large box at the start of a game, even with this Tuning.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Since a lot of Compress’s combos utilize his melee, Embrittlement is quite good on him. Also makes any attacks made during or after a melee hit much more deadly. Makes you more threatening in close range since enemies must be weary of the Defense DOWN you can inflict.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>A strong option on Compress thanks to his high damage output and fairly easy time confirming kills. The 20% of PU/PC this provides can be very good, especially when paired with other PU/PC reliant tunes, namely ‘Muscle Form.’ Do keep in mind you’ll be sacrificing an Alpha DMG increase to run this however.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_01.png" width="125"> | **Muscle Form** <br>The HP provided on Plus Chaos allows you to delay using it until you know for sure you can’t get away. More importantly though, this provides you with extra armour upon using Plus Chaos, making it almost impossible to stop Compress’ Gamma with anything other than a grab attack, and lets Compress tank and walk through many problematic moves to get to safety.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch043_00.png" width="125"> | **Perception** <br>Highlighting enemies you melee is incredible for making sure they don't get away by weaving in and out of buildings or around obstacles. Compress already has a fantastic chase game, and Perception makes it even harder to escape him.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch017_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Technical** <br>Gives you an increase in reload speed every time your GP breaks. Allows you to get your Gamma back much quicker so you can run from or chase enemies more effectively. Combine with Plus Chaos for super fast reload speeds.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Only advisable if you're comfortable fighting early. Typically it will still be better to get Alpha to level 7 and then use this to get Gamma to level 9 faster. Since Compress is level dependent, getting additional cards can help him a lot in the early-mid game. You can also siphon any additional cards gotten to your teammates.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch034_00.png" width="125"> | **Reinforced Revive** <br>Compress can make decent use of this thanks to having an instant revive. Having to pick up your downed ally does make it harder to use though since you put yourself in harm's way to grab a teammate. Assess the situation before getting too greedy with this Tuning.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Strike** <br>Gives you an increase in attack power every time your GP breaks. Good for equalizing fights you start losing. Makes his combos and TOD hit harder. Combine with Plus Chaos for crazy damage.|

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Deku’s reliance on his Alpha for damage is great news for Compress, as his Beta reflects it back for big damage on trigger happy opponents. If you hold your Beta out the most common counter will be to close distance and knock you out of it with his Beta, so watch for this response. His Gamma can be blocked, and if he uses it for movement, Compress can pretty easily catch up once he has both Gammas himself. His melee is unfortunately quite fast however, meaning he can easily break out of melee chains done on GP. Watch for the Beta and his Gamma grab combo, and this matchup favours Compress.
<br>
## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Unlike regular Deku, Compress struggles hard against Full Bullet. If he gets the jump on you he’ll be able to knock you down with his Alpha before you can put Beta up to reflect it. Your Beta also always reflects his Alpha as the unaimed version, meaning even when you do shoot it back it does very little damage. Once you’re knocked down and Full Bullet can attempt wake up catches is when the real struggle starts however, as Compress’s only real option in these disadvantageous scenarios is to use his i-frames to get distance and then Gamma away. To make matters worse, Full Bullet can catch your Gamma with the heel grab of his Beta, or if you take too long to teleport, can simply knock you over again with his Alpha and restart the cycle. If you can Gamma into the air while he's still falling with his Beta, you may be able to land some Alphas as he tries to recover.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Bakugo is another character who heavily relies on his easily reflectable Alpha. However in this match-up you can also reflect the grenades that Bakugo throws as well, and even block the splash damage from grenades that hit the round. Bakugo can counter this by throwing grenades behind you to get past your Beta and hit your back, but otherwise half of his kit is almost completely countered here. He also lacks combos to make up for this, meaning he loses a lot of damage output in this fight. On top of this his mobility is quite poor compared to Compress, meaning chase or escape is easy too. As long as you dodge his incredibly telegraphed Gamma, this match-up is a breeze in most situations. 
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Once again the skillset is better against Compress. Machine Gun loves to get in close and move around fast with non-linear movement, both things Compress hates. He excels at getting in your face and making marbles hard to hit, and if he's too close and you can't direct hit him, your Alpha will fly past him. Your Beta’s reflection is much less useful here too as his sporadic movement means reflected Alphas likely won’t fully connect, and if he uses Beta over you it’ll hit you anyway. To fight this character you must often predict where he’s going to go in order to properly hit him, which isn't always easy, especially when he's going after you or has teammates close by. Try to get the jump on him first and force a chase so he’s using his abilities to run instead of fight back.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Your Beta is very important in this match up. Compress can block Ochaco’s Alpha, stopping damage and ruining her momentum if she’s airborne. Additionally, if she throws her Beta you can reflect it to stun her and potentially start your own combo. The obvious downside of this match up is if she hits her Gamma on you, it's a near death combo that forces you into a wake-up catch situation. It can also lift you up out of your own Gamma. If she picks you up with her Gamma, Beta as soon as possible to try and block her Beta and Alpha. If she goes for her Beta to try and wake up catch you, you may be able to reflect it if she throws immediately, stunning her and buying time to get away with your Gamma. Her movement with Zero Gravity, while typically better than Compress’, does leave her open while activating it, and without it she may struggle to run or catch up. 
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Reflect her Alphas when at range for high damage, and dodge it when she charges it up in close range engagements. Her Beta, while good mobility, is worse than Compress’ and is easy to track due to its size. Her Gamma is once again the biggest issue, as getting caught in it means taking a lot of damage. Just like rapid Ochaco, this Gamma can also catch your teleport if you aren't careful. Her mobility is okay, but its unlikely she'll be able to catch up to Compress anytime outside of the final circles. Lots of Zero Satellite players will try to use her charged Gamma to create a safe spot to heal, but this is very easy for Compress to counter thanks to his great verticality when using his Gamma. Teleporting up to rain Alphas on her works wonders here, and forces her to run away, delaying her healing once more. You can even claim her island for yourself if needed. 
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Iida is one of Compress’ worst match ups. He excels in getting in your face and staying there, delivering high damage combos if you make just one mistake. His incredible movement makes him a nightmare to hit, especially the directs you need to stun him. None of his moves can be reflected or blocked, and his Gamma makes running away or chasing him quite difficult. His Air Melee adds another element to his movement and makes him even harder to predict when in the air. To punish him, dodge either his Alpha or his Beta, spin around and try to stun him with your Alpha to start your own combo. If he has no GP and can’t be stunned, he becomes incredibly hard to punish unless he messes up very badly. Getting the jump on him is your best bet, as his low base health means you can deal a lot of damage when he doesn’t see you coming.<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Another spammy character, Shoto loves shooting Alphas you can reflect. When a Shoto notices you start reflecting, the most common response is to use Gamma to try and freeze you so you can no longer fight back. Be ready to roll, and keep up the pressure with your own Alpha. Try your best to stay in a mid range when fighting Shoto, as getting close allows him to use his Beta on you for big damage or easily freeze you with Gamma. His mobility is much worse than Compress’ and you should be able to catch up or run easily. If he hides inside a building and blocks the door with his Beta, try to Gamma to another entrance to catch him off guard. If he uses Beta to create cover in the open, teleport over and rain Alphas on him or hold Beta to stop him from shooting you through the wall.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ice Fang is another good match-up for Compress, as long as you keep that nice midrange distance. Since his Alphas can freeze up close, and his Beta and Gamma both excel in that range, it's very important to not get too close. Just like with strike Shoto, reflecting his Alpha will likely trigger Ice Fang to go for his Beta spike. This is harder to dodge, so be especially careful here. The explosion after is more telegraphed fortunately, and not as hard to dodge, especially if you use your i-frames. The explosion can knock you out of your marble when using Gamma if you aren't careful. If you get Ice Fang low or start a shoot off, they’ll likely use Gamma to block your shots, which you can either teleport over, or absorb with your Beta to remove his cover. He has no mobility, so he can’t chase or escape easily.
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Tsuyu’s main combo involves her getting close using her Alpha, and then going into Beta you. Blocking her Alpha will stop her momentum, and leave her open to a counter attack while she's stuck in the air. If she tries to Beta you dodge her aerial one by rolling to the side. The grounded Beta is a bit harder, but you’ll see most success rolling away from her rather than behind her, as the tongues hitbox will still reach back there if you mistime it. If she misses her ground Beta, she's left wide open, allowing for an easy punish. Her mobility lets her move similar distances to Compress, but while slightly more versatile in where she moves it's also slower, giving neither a clear advantage there. Watch for the extra movement granted by her air melee however, as it allows her to weave around you more easily in close quarters. If she's in your face, dodge her Betas, and then Gamma away.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Despite his terrible mobility, Kirishima actually doesn’t fare too badly against Compress in other departments. For starters none of his attacks can be reflected or blocked by Compress’ Beta, making the move useless in this fight. Additionally Kirishima is one of the kings of wake up catches, with his two most powerful moves knocking you down on hit and being great at catching you too. Compress hates being put in these kinds of situations as he has very limited options on what can be done on wake up. The worst part of this match up for Compress however is actually Kirishima's Special Action. Hardening completely removes the stun from Compress’ Alpha, one of his best tools, and also cuts the damage by a large amount. The only reason Compress doesn't lose this match up is purely because of Kirishima’s terrible movement. In areas with buildings/high ground, Compress' best option is to try and stay above Kiri and use his Alpha to scare him away, or force him to eat damage on his approach, before running and repeating over and over. If Kirishima had movement, he’d be an absolute nightmare for Compress.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Compress’ greatest nightmare, Red Drive takes all the good things about Assault Kirishima and gives it movement. This is likely Compress’ worst match up. Everything said about Kirishima’s Special Action before is true once more, except now he is also much harder to hit. Red Drive’s Special Action basically makes him unpunishable in the Compress match up. Alongside that, his combo game and damage potential are insane, easily out performing Compress. It’s even harder to benefit from catching Red Drive off guard due to his much larger health pool, and Special Action meaning you may not even be stunning him when you do get the drop. The only redeeming factor of this match up is that Compress can reflect Red Drive’s Gamma, which is actually a very big deal here. Red Drive players love to spam this when you’re out of range or in the air, so this gives you an opportunity to deal high damage back from relative safety since you can easily be hit if you try to spam your Alpha while up high. It's best to try to stay above him using your Alpha in moderation and reflecting his Gamma when he tries to hit you back. While his movement is excellent, Compress can make ground initially when it comes to getting away. Even if he can catch up fairly well, it at least gives Compress a chance to run.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Compress can easily reflect Kaminari’s Alpha shots, and keep up with him due to his lesser mobility. His Beta will leave him stationary, so use this to your advantage if he ever misses it to deal huge damage to him. If you're ever caught inside, try and back up while spamming Alphas at him now that he can't move. The thing that evens out this match-up is just how high the damage is when Kaminari lands his Gamma on you. While telegraphed, it still comes out decently fast, and if you're hit you’ll take huge damage, or maybe even go down if the Kaminari is with a coordinated team. His Special Action also makes landing melee combos on him impossible without being countered, severely limiting your methods of damage outside of using your Alpha, or reflecting his.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Compress’ Beta will block his mines, as well as reflect or block his Alpha depending on how it's being fired. This counters the players who like to sit on high ground and snipe quite well. Additionally, Compress' fantastic vertical movement means he can easily confront these snipers too. Compress’ Gamma is once again all around better movement than Lightning’s Gamma. While Lightning’s Gamma can still electrify you, his lesser damage means getting hit isn’t nearly as game ending for you. That's not to say it isn't still threatening however, so do still be careful in close ranges where he can stun and gun you easily. Continue to be weary of his Special Action preventing your melee combos too.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
An excellent match up for Compress, he easily out performs Momo in most situations. Her lack of movement or consistent ranged damage is very noticeable here, as she essentially can't do anything to you in even a midrange engagement, and even less if you're above her. Her Beta, while it does block your shots, is very simple to dodge, and can also be teleported over to rain Alphas from above. If she uses it to run you can hit her from behind or Gamma to catch up. Her Gamma isn’t great outside, and is also a non-factor in most head to head fights. The cannonballs can also be reflected by your Beta if needed, and its splash damage can be blocked. Her Alpha is the only good thing for her as it easily knocks down and allows for wake up catching with her Gamma. It can be reflected however, so predict when she uses it and you’ll stun her to start your own combo. The only place she can turn tides is inside where her close range expertise can excel, especially her cannons. For the most part, just don’t follow her inside because that's where she wants to be.

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>
While this match up is often decided by what quirks Monoma is currently in possession of, he does have something else he can take advantage of. Obviously his Special Action refreshing is what beings referred to here, essentially giving him unlimited movement with his Beta and stolen quirks. In early to midgame, Monoma is nearly impossible to catch up to thanks to his refresh unless he gets very cocky and doesn’t get far enough away. If his Special Action depletes or he doesn't go far enough, Compress’ double Gamma is good movement against him. If he’s able to copy your Gamma it makes his mobility even scarier. His refresh also allows Monoma to constantly spam a variety of other moves, many of which Compress could possibly struggle with. In terms of his base kit his Alpha does so little damage it's often not worth reflecting if he has your Alpha already, and instead you should mostly just trade Alphas since yours does so much more damage. His beta is the biggest issue just because it's a fast melee attack, but it fortunately isn't too threatening. If he enters his Gamma try not to hit him so he doesn't get given yours, unless he starts healing, in which case you’ll need to stop him. When it comes to Monoma's who air stall, Compress does actually do quite well against them. Your double Gamma allows you to get incredibly high in the air, and even if he’s still above you your Alphas range can still allow you to hit him. Grab a teammate with your Special Action and bring them up there too to try and force him down even faster.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Kendo’s shield is a huge problem for Compress in a fight. Its huge size and high health means in a one on one situation, there's really no way to hit Kendo until you can wear down her shields health. To make matters worse, if the item from Compress’ Alpha isn't released before hitting the shield, it will only take the 5 damage the marble hits for instead of the much larger damage done by the item and shockwave. Kendo is another character who loves wake up catching too, and her Gamma is excellent for this. Her Alpha also does big damage while in close range, and while you can reflect it for big damage back she may bait you into this before hitting you with Gamma. Her melee combo game is also very good, and much better than Compress’, so be careful there too. Try to just keep her at a distance to whittle down her shield and run with your Gamma if she gets close. Fortunately she doesn't have the movement to chase or run from Compress, so without her shield she’s a sitting duck.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Unfortunately Kendo has been given movement to chase and run from Compress, turning an already bad match up into a terrible one. While Compress’ double Gamma is still better overall for distance, Twin Palm’s Gamma into air melee movement is incredible and she can definitely still catch up if you aren’t careful, especially early game or in smaller final circles. Her Alpha will stun you too (even through Gammas armour) and although you can reflect it to stun her and use Gamma to get away or start your own combo, you're bound to take high damage if you’re hit. Her Beta allows her to soak up damage while increasing its power, and like Kirishima prevents your Alpha from stunning her, nullifying Compress’ greatest strength. All of her moves can easily force wake up catches too. If she tries to catch you with a charged Alpha or while you're in the air, hold Beta and force her to miss her Alpha or take the reflected hit so you can Gamma. If she keeps holding it, move to cover or break line of sight to try getting away with Gamma. If she doesn't charge the Alpha she could pretty much try anything, so it's best to just try and dodge what she chooses. Trying to reflect an uncharged Alpha is not worth taking a Beta or Gamma if you predict wrong.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Ibara can be a very scary fight when on Compress. With her Alpha she has huge range and even bigger damage, putting Compress at the disadvantage as he can’t block it with his Beta and it knocks him down. Her Beta, especially at higher levels, is great at both knocking you down and catching your wake up if you aren't careful. Her Gamma does insane damage directly to your HP, and like all grabs can hit you through your Gamma’s armour and stop it going off. Her close range expertise means you rarely want to try and melee her, especially since she has armour on all of her moves. All of her moves do leave her as a stationary target on a whiff, so make sure to capitalize on that to return big damage or get distance from her if you're in her Beta/Gamma range. The sky and tall buildings are unsurprisingly your best bet in this fight, as she's limited to using only her Alpha and being an easy target to hit if she misses while you look down on her. If you're in the air and she hits you however, you become a lot easier to hit again as your recovery takes away a lot of your momentum, making you a slow moving target in the open air. Make sure to utilize your i-frames so you aren't an easy target for a second hit.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While Mirio is prone to exploding if you can catch him off guard, his movement and love for close up encounters can sometimes put Compress at the disadvantage. He loves close quarters fights, and his movement is also superb, being one of very few characters who can outright get away from Compress. His Gamma being able to block your projectiles and force you in close can be good to bait you into an uncomfortable position. What helps Compress the most in this match up is Mirio’s low health pool, and easily exploitable punish windows upon an Alpha or Beta whiff. These leave Mirio stationary and if you're fast enough to hit him can lead to him taking big damage. If you aren't quick enough however, he can reset the situation if he enters his Special Action for invincibility to wait out his cooldowns. In his Special Action he can also just run up to you directly without threat to force close range fights. In this situation it's best to either run yourself, or use Gamma to get away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Fitting his namesake, Sheer Counter is an excellent counter to just about everything Compress wants to do. For starters his Alpha makes him invincible, meaning not only can you not hit him with your own Alphas, but reflected Alphas don’t hit him back either unless he stands still. This is terrible for Compress, as your main method of damage is completely stopped here, and you can’t stun him either. His counter is also a fantastic move against Compress. Since your offensive gameplan pretty much boils down to spam Alpha, it's very easy for Sheer Counter to predict this and time his Gamma accordingly. Your Alphas huge size and the shockwave after make it especially easy for him to counter you. While his movement isn’t superb compared to Compress’, he actually has a way to counter your Gamma too. By timing his Gamma alongside yours, hitting him with the smoke bomb you drop will send him straight after you to easily knock you back down. You must play cautiously around Sheer Counter, baiting his counter so you can punish him on a whiff or run away. His Beta can be similarly punished if he misses, and fortunately isn’t too strong of a move. His Special Action is still a problem letting him engage you for free, except you now have to be careful about timing his counter if you try and Gamma away from him while he’s in it.

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Although his Alpha is blocked by your Beta, the grab version of it can still be quite scary as a hit means you’re likely to be losing a large chunk of your health. That being said, a whiff or hit into your Beta often lets you squeeze an Alpha hit back at him while he recovers, giving you the sustainability to win the fight. His Beta is a bit trickier, as its tracking and movement speed can sometimes make it a bit awkward to dodge. On hit it also gives him invisibility, so make sure you keep track of him if he knocks you down. Learning the dodge window for this move makes it much more bearable since it's his best option against Compress. His Gamma is fortunately not a huge problem for Compress. While it will always be annoying as a third party tool, in a direct fight Compress can just block it with his Beta. If you catch a Tamaki using it with their back turned or if they miss, they’re a sitting duck and you can often deal huge damage or even downright knock them if they don’t cancel it fast enough.

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Easily one of Compress’ best match ups, Nejire is one of only three characters whose entire moveset can be stopped by Compress’ Beta. Her Alpha is nothing special, being overall worse than Compress’ and reflectable using your Beta. Her Beta can be blocked with yours, and while it is good for knocking you down she sort of struggles to catch Compress’ wake up thanks to everything being blockable. You can allow her to waste her Betas charge firing into your own Beta, and then Alpha her back when she gives up. If she isn't looking at you her Beta leaves her a mostly stationary target to wail on. Her Gamma can give her height making her harder to hit, but once more can be reflected, although it rarely actually hits her back. Her movement is all around worse than Compress’ and while her floating can make it more difficult to hit her, it isn't that hard if you can get used to it. Even if you can’t just wait for her to come down since she can’t do anything to you up there anyway.

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While his Alpha can be blocked, often allowing you to slip in an Alpha while he recovers, his sheer damage potential and team combo potential still make this match up quite hard. Shinso is another character who thrives in catching your wake up with his Gamma and Beta. Teleporting into the air while he falls with his Beta is a great way to both take loads of damage and get knocked out of your marble, wasting a charge. This combined with the fact that the brief animation before you teleport leaves you wide open to being hit by his Gamma, Alpha, or even his Special Action, means your best wake up option is incredibly risky if you can't find a safe spot to use it. His Gamma allows him to land all his moves much easier if it connects, and it can even be mixed into combos for a guaranteed hit to make running even harder. On a miss however, he does leave himself quite open while he recovers which will allow you to spam Alphas in return. This also applies to his Special Action. His movement is also quite good, and while he may not have the distance to fully completely get away, he can certainly move around in ways that will make him awkward to both track down or finish off.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even/Favorable🟢<br>
He's very manageable just watch out for his armored beta and invincible gamma if you try to start a combo. He's mostly going to be dash jump alphaing so just do the same, timing your alphas for when he lands. If he tries to run with beta just throw yours at him and if that doesn't down him you can chase if you want or just let it be since he has better movement than you. His super jump is terrible for escaping though, good all mights will not be using this to escape but if an all might tries to use it upclose you just kill them for that with a combo.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
His alpha prevents him from getting stunned and increases how much he can take before knockdown. It also reduces the damage he takes by 10% which barely matters. If he's holding alpha just start dash jumping to throw alphas at him and try to avoid his. Sometimes it can also be easier to be near the All Might and just constantly swap between being in front of him and being behind him, this can make it hard for the All Might to consistently hit you depending on their camera sensitivity. If he tries to get close to gamma you just throw a beta at him to make him lose the CD. If he tries to beta, you just roll it. This applies to both forms of his beta. Don't get in gamma range. He doesn't have the greatest wake-up options if you knock him down so you can just call out his wake-up with melee, gamma, beta or Special Action.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His special action and alpha make this Match-up insufferable at times, if he grabs you, you get chunked, and his Special Action just prevents you from fighting back or running. If you can land your beta or gamma before he grabs you or negates you with Special Action, you just ToD him. If he's constantly air alphaing the best way to deal with him is trying to kite him with alphas since unlike Strike Shigaraki, your alpha will actually hit his kick off the ground, you can just hit him with alpha debris mid-air or use gamma's dash on him after he kicks off the ground, since the tracking will usually hit him before he has a chance to alpha again during the flip, and from there you can either do an air combo or just go for gamma's shockwave for immediate damage which, if he's guard broken, you can just do a gamma shockwave combo. If he tries to run, your alpha hits his alpha kick so you can use that to your advantage.

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Present Mic outranges you, if he's on high ground toss a beta to try and force him back and if his boombox is right next to him also make him get rid of it for a second. If he's on low ground just try to keep breaking the boombox with alpha since it does reduce his DPS. ToD-ing him is the best way to get rid of him but be aware that he can just beta you for hitting him with beta if you're too far to follow up with gamma as a true combo. He will also beta you for getting too close and then chunk you with either alpha or gamma as a follow up.

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Dealing with Cementoss can be annoying since all his structures will block your attacks. Assault Shigaraki also can't reliably ToD him because of his alpha towering, so if you do plan to try to go for the ToD getting some damage in advance with alphas is a good way to make sure he dies once you get your hands on him. Mostly just try to avoid his attacks and take whatever openings you can get, if all you can do is go for beta into alpha just take it. Save your gammas for positioning unless you know for a fact you can kill him after landing it. Do not ever follow him into a tight space.

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His Special Action and beta makes him annoying to deal with since the former lets him float, reducing your combo damage. His beta is an extremely good get off of me/get back over here tool since it sends you towards him. If he's just floating with his Special Action you can try to throw a beta at him then use your own Special Action, assuming you're in range so your alpha debris shots do more damage, making it a bit easier. If he holds alpha on the ground you get to combo him for it. If he runs be aware that his beta will often be used to cut off your approach angles on him, he does slightly outpace your movement with his Special Action but not so much to the point where you can't keep up. If you try to run be mindful of that gamma since it hits through walls, if you decide to run try to have more than 200 HP so if he does call you out with gamma you at least live and can possibly still get away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His beta is really strong at closing off an area since the wall hitbox can be deceptive to where rolling will sometimes still get caught, if you're in his beta he gets to alpha or gamma you for big damage. If he alpha dumps you after beta be aware that his gamma is really good at catching your wake up option, so try to get away from it while you still have your i-frames. Like Strike Endeavor, he will also be using Special Action to float a good bit. You can do the same thing with a beta stun into your own Special Action to make your alpha debris hit a bit harder. Unlike Strike Endeavor, it can be easier to do an air combo on him since he doesn't have great tools for keeping someone off of him in the air, since his gamma only explodes on impact and does have startup "lag", and his beta only hits the floor so air combos can be pretty good against him if you get enough damage beforehand to actually kill him with one.

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
He outranges you, you cannot chase him and he will chase you to the ends of the earth. Assault Shigaraki is relying on dodging his beta and punishing him with a ToD during his endlag or catching him by surprise before he notices you at all. If he is in beta flight just roll the slashes or try and knock him out of it with gamma's shockwave, but be aware this is risky since he can just smack you for it and then you've lost a gamma. Hawks's gamma also gives him an easy time chasing you since it allows him to know your location the entire time it's active, as well as making it hard to sneak up on him if he tries to flee while you're marked. He's not hard to deal with, mostly just annoying.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢 (Small Form)<br>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴 (Giant Form)<br>
Don't be too close to her, despite her alpha only doing 50 per hit it still fires twice per 1 ammo with a fast fire rate, letting her get some really solid damage really quickly in close range. However, after her nerfs, her combos aren't too threatening. The main concern in this Match-Up is her giant form. If she decides to just go big you cannot contest that and just need to try and get somewhere that she can't chase you or hit you. Fighting her in locations where she's small makes her easy to deal with. If you beta her while she isn't using her own beta, she gets combo'd for free. You both have similar movement since she has gamma jump canceling and you have gamma shockwave, so you can chase each other easily on the ground, assault shig does have a better time moving vertically though thanks to the 2 Special Action charges.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Indoors he will win so just don't contest him indoors. He outranges you and his AoE is better than yours. Grab will also chunk your health bar so if he does land that just try to always mix up whether you air-wake or not, since Strike Shigaraki has a 50/50 follow up with his Special Action off his gamma. If he's putting out alphas constantly just dash jump away from them and throw alphas at him or beta stun him, just be aware if he reads you with his gamma or does beta close to the ground he can get to grab you for free. This is one of the few times where using gamma to go up into the air then pelt down alphas and betas is a solid option, but beware this does run the risk of getting you shot by others. If he alpha stacks where you're about to land you can use your Special Action to move away from his alpha stacks.

Throw alphas from afar to avoid being in combo range, let the other Assault Shigaraki approach first. If he tries to gamma at you try to roll it then beta or gamma him and combo for it. You can also throw a beta at him first to just get free alphas.

Don't contest him indoors, be aware that beta can be used to attack you around corners. If you decide to chase him roll his gamma. His jump height makes alphaing him a bit harder but just adjust your timing a bit and you can hit his landings pretty easily. Other quirks can make this Match-up annoying sometimes.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Alpha and beta do not care about his traps, gamma is the main thing going for him in this Match-up, and his alpha is fiction. If the Tech Dabi is sitting in traps, alpha will break them and beta just lets you stun him. Do not gamma at him or you will get hit by a trap. Just use gamma to break away or hit him through walls. Gamma's shockwave can also be an option for starting combos on him since you can use the flip to maneuver away from traps but still hit him, thoug not really recommended when you just win the ranged game for free.

If he's betaing at you, throw your own at him. If he's alphaing, throw alphas or a beta at him. You cannot do combos that involve gamma, Special Action or melee on him while he has gamma active. He does eat away at his own health so Assault Shigaraki's DoT + his own self damage really melts his HP, so beta into alpha mash to get rid of him.

She outranges you from really far away so just break the line of sight. Up close betas hurt, but they're easily dodgable, so you can just knock her out of it with a beta or gamma shockwave. Gamma's dash runs the risk of getting hit even if used from behind her. If she's betaing you can mostly just run and throw and alpha then keep doing it. If she takes your blood and transforms near you that is your window to combo her. If she's just using transformation to CD reset you can still combo her for doing it pretty easily, just be aware her transformation does have i-frames on start so she can use that to avoid a stun move. Running from her can be difficult if she has your blood since she has her movement + your movement + hers again. That also applies to chasing.

This Match-up is terrible. If she's CD resetting it's very hard to contest her, since she can just sit in the air for free, and if she turns into Assault Shigaraki she now has the potential to ToD you as well. She's harder to punish for transforming than her tech counterpart since her gamma lets her do it automatically, or she can just go up high reliably before transforming. Trying to bait and avoid her gamma then ToDing her is the best way to deal with her. Running usually isn't an option since she'll just pull you back with gamma.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Basically the same as how you fight most beamers, he outranges you but unlike most of them, he can increase his DPS with his beta clone, but your own alpha easily kills the clone while still being able to hit him. If he's on high ground you can just try to use beta to force him to step back to break line of sight. If he's in mid-range and tries to gamma to close the gap, you can just push him back with double beta or count his gammas and try to stay out of range until he's out or at one of them, then either combo him when he's out or try and force a trade when he's at one then combo him. His gamma is good at catching wake-ups in close range but overall he's not too hard to deal with.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Compress' alpha stun is his best tool against you since if he gets it, your guard is gone and so is some HP. If he's holding up his beta you just throw alphas at his feet or gamma him if you're close enough, but be aware that he can dodge your gamma if he reacts. If you throw alpha debris or beta debris, they will be reflected at you with higher damage. His gamma is hard to stop unless you've already beta'd him, so if you knock him down there isn't much you can do to stop his escape option if he isn't immediately one shot. If he's sitting on high ground just toss a beta at the wall to force him back. He can easily chase you since his gamma goes really far. If he's just tossing trucks down after gammaing up just try to avoid as many as you can and when he lands try to chunk him for it if he doesn't immediately gamma back up.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Overhaul's ability to heal himself and smack you off of him can make trying to ToD him less enticing to go for. Gamma in this match-up is mostly just for manuevering and breaking off to heal if needed, or just catching a roll with gamma's shockwave while he's on HP to do a gamma shockwave combo. Gamma's dash will get you smacked off of him most of the time. Beta debris into alpha mash is mostly what you'll be using in this match-up combo wise. Try to stay at a range where his gamma is still reactable so you can easily dodge it, dash jump alphas are mostly what you're using in this. If you see him pop special action to heal himself this is where you ToD him.

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Kurogiri's gamma remote portal vortex can be difficult to deal with since he can just keep himself out of Assault Shiggy's range. Gammaing up to get in range to throw his projectiles at will often get you beta pulled towards the Kurogiri player, so do not to do this. Mostly just try to predict when he's going to throw an attack at you with his portal vortex or try to immediately break line of sight and lose it. Against Kurogiri himself if you do beta in the air at all you will likely get pulled so doing it on the ground and dodge rolling after the throw is best to avoid getting punished for free. It can go either way but Kurogiri overall has the edge.
