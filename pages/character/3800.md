*The elusive magician puts on an enchanting show and pickpockets with precision.*

Mr. Compress is an expert in both offense and defense, being an excellent damage dealer and supporting teammates, as well as using his high mobility to sneak up on opponents or escape tense situations. Use his Alpha to burst down opponents, his Beta to block moves aimed at you or teammates, and his Gamma to chase, flee, loot, move allies or reposition. A character that loves sticking around areas with plenty of verticality where he can easily change his elevation and mask his location, but must be very wary of close-quarter brawls.

## Alpha Skill - Production Magic

<p align="center">

</p>

Mr. Compress’ Alpha is his best move by far and his most reliable source of damage. It consists of 3 main components: the initial marble he throws, the object that comes out  and the shockwave once it lands.

### The Marble
The marble has a few unique properties. For starters, no matter the level of your Alpha, a direct hit with the marble will always deal 5 damage (although you will often see 75 instead because the 2nd part of his alpha will also hit), a fairly insignificant amount but it starts to pile up once it gets combined with the other parts of the Alpha. On top of this extra damage, hitting an opponent who has GP will cause them to be stunned in place, allowing you to follow up with more alphas as the opponent won't be able to move. This aspect of his Alpha, alongside its decently low downpower, turns Compress in a GP destroying machine, very hard to counteract once you’re stunned. 

The marble also travels in a different way from any other projectile currently in the game; after throwing the marble, instead of going straight forward like a generic projectile, it will actually travel on an arc. On top of that, if the marble hits a wall or the floor it will bounce off instead of dissapearing. It's very much worth noting however that both of these properties change when you enter Aim Mode: the arc/angle at which Compress throws the marble is much different, allowinging it to travel farther distances and slowing the spawning of the object inside the marble. Most importantly, because of both of these variations, in Aim Mode, bouncing the marble off of objects or a wall to hit enemies is much easier.

</p>

### The Object

These items include the barrel at levels 1-3, the boulder at 4-6, and the truck at 7-9, each being bigger than the previous (Trucks are especially excellent at hitting enemies standing too close to the edge of a corner, like doorways for example, thanks to this expanded size and hitbox). This part of the Alpha is the move that deals most of the damage when playing Compress. Do try to always keep one alpha in your pocket, as the penalty reload is much longer than the individual charges returning. What you will need to be careful with is his downpower when in combination with teammates. Opponents getting hit by multiple moves at once alongside Compress' alpha will be knocked down much quicker, meaning sometimes it may be better for you to throw fewer Alphas if your teammates can deal more damage with their own moves. This will also apply to opponents being hit by the moves of other opponents.

</p>

### The Shockwave

The shockwave from Compress’ alpha comes out from the released object when it hits the ground, with its size and damage being dictated by level just like with the object itself. There’s really nothing special about the shockwave, aside from the fact it expands the range at which you can hit enemies not currently in your line of sight.
With that being said, the changes to DP have effected the shockwave. Due to its DP being increased to 50 alongside the main Alpha object, landing both that and the shockwave can mean knocking opponents over much faster than usual. While some characters don't mind knocking opponents down to force wake-up catches, Compress does not like these kind of situations. As such, in some cases it may be advantageous to purposely make sure the shockwave portion of the alpha misses your opponent so that they stay standing longer. This allows both you and teammates to attack enemies for longer than if the shockwave had caused them to be knocked down faster. Do keep in mind however that if you have teammates who possibly do like attempting wake-up catches, it may be worth still hitting the shockwave as long as they're with you. Hitting all 3 parts of Compress's alpha is also much easier when attacking from above, as normally at ground level the shockwave goes past the target you've hit with the marble, while if you hit them from above you can avoid this.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand

</p>

Compress’ Beta Skill is a barrier that can stop projectiles from hurting him or allies.
When a projectile hits this barrier, Compress will quickly compress it and reflect it back, dealing some extra damage the original projectile didn't have. 

Different Moves can have 3 types of interactions with Compress' Beta: Reflect, Block and Ignore.

</p>

**Reflectable Moves**

Reflectable moves are attacks that upon hitting Compress's shield will be sent back to the enemy, dealing increased damage. Usually, projectiles are reflectable, while melee attacks are usually not reflectable. Reflected moves are not guaranteed to hit the target, especially if they're moving quickly. For a list of reflectable moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

</p>

**Blockable Moves**

Blockable moves are attacks that upon hitting Compress's shield will vanish, but won't be reflected back to the original user. While these won't do damage to the enemy, it will also cause no damage to you. For a list of blockable moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/MrB2.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Ignored Moves**

Ignored moves are attacks that do not interact with Compress's shield, hence, they will ignore it and damage him. Moves in this category are often shockwaves, physical attacks, or area attacks that might also hit Compress from behind. For a list of ignored moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

</p>

Beta is Compress’ most defensive tool, able to block all sorts of damage as you can see above. This has a variety of uses, the most obvious of which is to use it mid shoot off to reflect alphas at trigger happy opponents. Swapping back and forth between this and your alpha conserves your own health and can often force enemies into engaging with you close up so you can start Melee combos. This move is percentage based, meaning you can hold it up as much as you want, but the more hits it absorves the more percentage gets consumed until it's forced into reload. A helpful tip is that this move can be rolled to avoid the EndLag of deactivating it.
However this isn't the only way to use your Beta; other uses consist in leaning into Compress’ Support role by protecting. teammates from taking damage too. Stand in front of allies opening boxes, supply drops or even finishing enemies to stop your opponents from interrupting your team. Even standing in front of an ally while they have a shoot off, essentially making them invincible while the fight is happening. Beta is widely considered one of the worst moves in the game, so show everyone just how useful (or annoying) it can actually be.

## Gamma Skill - Magician's Choice
<p align="center">

</p>

Mr. Compress' Gamma is all about movement. With this move, he compresses himself into a marble and performs a high leap into the air, leaving a cloud of smoke behind. This Skill can be used to reposition, run away, chase enemies, gain height, dodge attacks, truly a jack of all trades when it comes to mobility. Not only that, but when levelling this skill to level 9 you will gain a second charge, giving it even more potential uses.

You need to be careful when you use it, as due to its slow recharge time being caught without it can sometimes be a death sentence or the reason an opponent escapes. For this reason using the Gamma offensively is for the most part a fairly unwise decision when playing Compress, especially early game before you have the levels for a quicker recharge. If you do use it offensively, it's best done when you already have the second charge you get with level 9 or when you can guarantee it will do damage, such as using it to end a combo. You could also use it to catch the wake up of people who mash and don’t use their i-frames, as the explosion at higher levels has a decent size and damage.
One of the main reasons that make this move good is that Compress will gain Hyper Armor while doing his animation, allowing him to almost always at least enter his marble and drop his bomb on wake up catches or start his flight while running away. Some things to keep in mind are that Hyper Armor doesn't stop damage at all, it will just avoid getting knock downed, and that you do NOT have armor while in the marble itself and can be knocked out of it, essentially wasting your charge. Some moves can also hit through the move's armor and knock you down regardless.

## Special Action - Magic Resurrection
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch038.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Compress' Special Action lets him compress and pocket an ally at any time, as long as he is close to them. If the ally was alive when pocketed, they will stay in the pocket and regain health (HP) slowly (they can break out of the pocket at any time by pressing any attack button). If the ally was downed, Compress will still pick them up but they won't get healed over time, instead they'll get revived once uncompressed.

Now, the most clear and obvious use of this is to pick up a downed teammate in order to revive them, but this might not be the best idea in every situation. As weird as it might sound, sometimes you need to let your allies die. If, for example, a Strike Shigaraki and an All Might are both spamming Alpha on your downed teammate, not only will you probably not make it in time to save them, but you might also get killed yourself. Now this isn't to say never rescue your teammates, but just be aware of who’s around and what situation both you and your downed teammate are in before committing to the rescue. Additionally, if you do manage to pick up a downed teammate, keep in mind you don't always need to teleport away with Gamma; sometimes just walking behind cover is more than enough if the focus is elsewhere and so you don't leave your third teammate fighting alone while you're coming back from teleporting away. A lot of times picking someone up just to drop them immediately works, especially if they have their own mobility, as it means you can stay in the action to help your other teammate once more while they run and heal. This is especially good in final circles where you can’t guarantee there will even be anywhere safe to bring them if you try to Gamma away. A neat little trick you can actually do when you're the one being carried by Compress is pressing the Jump or Attack button once your time reaches zero to instantly revive yourself without needing to go through the uncompressing animation. Compress' Special Action isn't just useful for downed teammates, though.

Carrying non-downed teammates can be practical: being able to carry non-mobile teammates long distance or even high mobility ones to save them from wasting their own abilities. You can use this to enter fights, traverse buildings/terrain, or even help someone escape before they go down, all while slowly regaining HP. The main advantage of this is potential heal-offs in final circles. Although not a common way for games to end, if it comes down to it, Compress can put a teammate in his pocket to not only passively heal storm damage, but also prevent storm damage affecting them whatsoever, in most situations essentially guaranteeing a win. Using it in this way is better when you can communicate with your team directly so they know why you want to pick them up, but don’t hesitate to try it with randoms either if they cooperate.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 2-string combo, Compress’ Ground Melee consists of 2 different hits before knocking down the opponent. With the first hit Compress will strike the enemy with his cane in a sideways motion. This is the part of Compress’ Melee you'll be using the most. For the second hit, he spins his cane in his hand hitting the opponent multiple times and causing them to be knocked down. It's used as a combo ender. Compress’ first Melee hit can be chained into itself a maximum of 5 times before knocking over an opponent. For this reason, it's best to hit 4 in a row and then knock over with the second hit for max damage. It's important to note that compared to many other Melees, Compress’s is actually quite slow due to him reeling back the cane before his first strike. This often means that in situations where you and the enemy both go for a Melee, Compress will often be the one getting hit and allowing your opponent to start potential combos. If you're not fast enough, it can also result in your Melee chains being broken via the enemy's melee (or roll).

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Compress' Air Melee is an uppercut with the cane, knocking opponents into the air. Used as a combo starter or tool to quickly knock back nearby opponents. 
Best used when dropping in from above, such as when falling from highground or from a Gamma teleport as the momentum allows you to combo into more Melees easier.

## Leveling Paths
### Standard Path
This is the level up path on Mr. Compress. It's by far his best option and there really isn't any other that comes close to it. Getting your Alpha to level 7 is to get your item size to Trucks as fast as possible. This allows Compress to deal much more consistent damage with his bigger Alpha and rely less on aim than with his smaller projectiles. Because Compress struggles to deal consistent damage early on, this is the best way to support your team and yourself through early engagements. Gamma to 9 afterward is to make sure you have Compress’ best movement option available, as he doesn't get the second charge of his Gamma until level 9. This allows you to chase, run and move around much faster and over greater distances. Alpha to level 9 after is for the extra charge you get at the final level and for increased damage. Beta can wait until the end as the size and ammo increases it gets are rarely needed, and the increased reflection damage, while nice, should be secondary to your movement and primary source of damage. If you want you can delay leveling your Beta even longer and instead give level up cards to your team once your Alpha and Gamma are both maxed.

</p>

### Escape Path
This level up path can be used when you spawn in and absolutely nobody is around for you to fight. This would mean that you realistically shouldn't need to level up your Alpha right away, and can instead focus on your movement for faster looting. The version in which you level Alpha to 4 is precautionary just in case people end up coming to your area regardless. It can also be used when you are having a particularly bad time looting, such as suffering an early death, to just simply get your movement online to ensure you don’t go down again. While this has the potential to be an okay alternative to the main path, you don’t particularly need 2 Gammas to loot fast on Compress, and in the event a team does rotate to your general location, having your level 7 Alpha is just so good for consistency. This could work for players who can already confidently hit Alphas regardless of size, and don’t necessarily need the extra size provided by the truck projectile. This path could also work for a more supportive style of play on Compress, allowing you to both get to civilians faster, and quickly move in and out of fights to use team heals when your allies find themselves in a bad spot. Alternatively, you could also use this in unranked games to practice your aim with lower level versions of the Alpha. Beta is levelled last for the same reason as before.

### Escape Path: Cautious Ver.
A variation of the previous path in which you level Alpha to 4 as a precautionary measure just in case people end up coming to your area regardless.

## Techs
Mr. Compress has 3 special behaviors that you can learn to enhance your gameplay.
### Air Extension
After using gamma, you can spam the melee button to perform air melees. This will allow you to fall a bit slower, allowing you to traverse a greater distance or stall in the air for a longer amount of time.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 2 Cancelling
By inputting a melee attack while not holding a direction, waiting until the last moment to use his melee's second hit and then inputting a direction (backwards is best) you can cancel the animation of his cane spinning and start moving again immediately. This can be fully chained a total of 3 times, before knocking down the enemy on the fourth hit of your first melee, meaning ideally you want to let the cane spin finish after the third chain. This can also be done with Compress’ air melee by waiting until you’ve almost touched the ground, using air melee, and then holding forward, allowing for up to 2 extra air melees to come out. Unfortunately hitting the first 2 will hard knockdown an opponent, rendering the potential third useless.<br>
<br>
The input would be: Melee 1 (No Direction Key pressed) -> Wait (The delay you gotta wait might make you hit a 2nd Melee 1, but this is bad, you gotta wait a decent bit but not enough to trigger a 2nd Melee 1 instead of a Melee 2) -> Melee 2 -> Movement Key (preferrably back, with tiny delay to avoid cancelling Melee 2 too soon)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma Cancelling
This tech allows Mr. Compress to exit his Gamma early in some situations. By standing a small distance away from a ledge, and aiming down to about your waist level, Compress will exit his marble and briefly perform the start of the exit animation midair while also losing all of his momentum. This likely happens as the game sees Compress’ marble nearly hitting the ledge as him landing, and as such it boots you out prematurely. The biggest problem with this tech is that it is scarcely, if ever, actually a useful thing to perform. It's quite hard to imagine a situation where it isn’t much more time and cost effective to simply jump or even run off of whatever building you're on rather than wasting a charge of your Gamma. In very niche situations it may confuse chasing opponents who expect you to teleport far away thanks to the smoke cloud hiding you, but if you're caught you've very likely screwed yourself. If this is ever changed to possibly not remove Compress’ momentum it may become more niche, but until that day you’re likely better off avoiding it.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Mr. Compress's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: ? DP (Marble), 50 DP (Object), 50 DP (Shockwave)<br>
Beta Skill: - DP<br>
Gamma Skill: ? DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2: ? DP (Individually), ? DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: ? DP<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A basic combo that most characters have, using Air Melee as combo starter and chain it into a ground melee chain.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Melee -> Alpha -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A more optimized version of the previous combo adding an alpha for extra damage, though the alpha only works if the hit is on GP.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A classic Melee 1 spam chain that keeps the enemy locked in place for a while. This combo only works on HP, as Compress's melee is too slow for GP stun's quick recovery.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800c8-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A more complex melee chain that makes use of Melee 2 Cancel for combo extension.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800c3-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha
Mr. Compress's signature combo that everyone knows. It takes advantage of the marble's stun property on enemies with GP to deliver free damage. This combo breaks GP and doesn't work on HP.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800c5-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
An extension of the previous combo making use of the extra Downpower available to sneak in some melees for higher damage. This combo can also be executed by using Melee 1 as the combo starter and then skip one of the two Melee 1 that go after the four alphas. This combo is quite long, so feel free to interrupt it in a heated battle.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Gamma
A combo that makes use of the Alpha x4 combo plus the Melee 2 Cancel tech. While this combo is his strongest one, the true combo ends in Melee 2 Cancel, as the gamma isn't a "true combo". Since it's a long combo, you may want to interrupt it mid-execution if you're not in a 1v1.

</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Jump -> Alpha -> Air Melee -> Alpha
A varied combo that uses a lot of different moves. The first alpha must be on GP for the combo to work.

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Strike Slots: Alpha DMG > HP DMG > GP DMG > Melee DMG > Gamma DMG > Beta DMG**</a><br>
Alpha is Compress's primary damage source so it needs as much attack boost as possible. Compress can struggle against opponents with HP, so HP attack gives you a better chance to knock opponents you can’t stun. GP attack power is honestly just used as another Alpha attack power boost. Compress’ melee is quite important in a lot of his combos and for forcing people off you in close quarters so Melee attack is mostly for boosting combo damage. Gamma isn’t really something you want to attack with, but can be used to end combos or catch wake ups, so Gamma attack is for those scenarios. Your Beta already boosts the attack power of moves it reflects meaning you really don’t need Beta attack at all.

<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Assault Slots: [GP Defense >] HP Defense > Beta Defense > Gamma Defense > Alpha Defense > Melee Defense**</a><br>
GP defense isn't currently available to use but it is in the game files, and will definitely be the best when it comes out due to how often you replenish your GP. HP defense is the only kind of defense that currently provides use against every kind of hit, making it the best. Across the roster Beta’s tend to be the highest damaging moves, making defense against Beta good. A smaller number of characters have the previous point applied to their Gamma instead, making it the next best. While Compress’ Beta is a built-in Alpha counter, there are some characters who Alphas can bypass your Beta, and sometimes you may find yourself getting hit when your Beta is down. Alpha defense would be for those situations. Melee defense is just sort of the worst one thanks to Melees having a low effective range and because they don’t hit for tons when compared to regular quirks. This should not be a priority defense to get.

<a style="color: cyan !important;">**Rapid Slots: -**</a><br>

<a style="color: lime !important;">**Support Slots: HP+ = GP+ >>>> Down HP+ >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Run Speed+**</a><br>
HP and GP up both accomplish similar things. While you’ll likely get more use out of GP up since you restore GP more frequently, HP is good for surviving in the Poison Mist longer and against attacks that directly target your HP. GP is likely the better option on Compress, but both are beneficial, so it's up to you to decide what you prefer. Max down HP is pretty bad as you only benefit once you've already lost, and theoretically you wouldn’t even get value from it if you had the extra GP or HP from a different Support slot option. It can very rarely help you get revived if you aren't thirsted in two seconds or if you go down in the Poison Mist and need to survive a bit longer to get out or outlive another downed player. Run speed up sucks and should only be used on budget builds or costumes you want to test Special TUNINGS on so you don't waste better character data.

<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">**Technical Slots: Gamma Reload > Alpha Reload > PU/PC Reload > Beta Reload > Special Action Reload**</a><br>
Gamma is Compress’s lifeblood in a game, it's how he escapes, chases, rescues, everything. Getting this back faster should always be a priority. Alpha reload is next because it's his main damage source so getting it quick is really good, especially if you ever run out of charges and need to wait out the penalty reload. PU/ PC reload is next because you never know when that couple extra percent could save your life, and because the last two reloads aren't good on him. To actually run out of ammo for your Beta takes a ridiculous amount of blocking and even at low levels it very rarely runs out of charge so you don’t need this. Special Action reload is useless on Compress because his Special Action has about a 1 second reload.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>With how easily Compress is able to break GP, activating this Tuning shouldn’t be an issue. The increased speed at which you get both your Gammas and Alphas back will make fighting, running, and chasing much easier to do consistently. Essentially this functions as a better ‘Revenge Tech,’ as you don’t need to lose GP to get the same benefit.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Gives Compress highground for free without the need to use his Gamma. Also gives you an additional option on wake up by jumping before you Gamma. Makes spamming Alphas from above even easier, and makes landing the shockwave more reliable. Gets you above certain moves that are otherwise problematic. |
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>Makes you invincible every time your GP breaks, stopping combos or giving you an opportunity to disengage. At higher levels you can use a small GP or HP drink to heal before permeation ends, or if you aren’t knocked over a large GP drink if you time it well. Attacking will end the permeation early.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>Getting a movement speed boost for landing a melee is incredible with the movement system changes. Allows your Gamma to become even better for movement, and makes your Alpha, Gamma, and melee come out quicker than before, making Compress much more threatening.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>Gives you an opportunity to escape or keep fighting when you would have otherwise gone DOWN. It almost functions like a second life.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch026_00.png" width="125"> | **Ability Manifest** <br>Functions similarly to the ‘Revenge’ Special Tunings all wrapped into one. It will be reliant on what Quirk Skill cards you can find however, and what level they’re at for it to function at its highest potential. Best used with Tech cards, but is good with the others as well.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Great for increasing your Alpha damage even more. Great when used in tandem with other attack increasing Tuning like Embrittlement or Revenge Strike to make your damage potential even higher. Works best on outfits like Disguise: Sweater (Dangerous) and Cyberpunk (Dangerous).|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>Very useful since Compress is a level dependent character. He can get in and out of areas with a large box quickly thanks to his Gamma. Also gets you a full team heal and a revive card for support play. Not advised to drop on the large box at the start of a game, even with this Tuning.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Since a lot of Compress’s combos utilize his melee, Embrittlement is quite good on him. Also makes any attacks made during or after a melee hit much more deadly. Makes you more threatening in close range since enemies must be weary of the Defense DOWN you can inflict.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>A strong option on Compress thanks to his high damage output and fairly easy time confirming kills. The 20% of PU/PC this provides can be very good, especially when paired with other PU/PC reliant tunes, namely ‘Muscle Form.’ Do keep in mind you’ll be sacrificing an Alpha DMG increase to run this however.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_01.png" width="125"> | **Muscle Form** <br>The HP provided on Plus Chaos allows you to delay using it until you know for sure you can’t get away. More importantly though, this provides you with extra armour upon using Plus Chaos, making it almost impossible to stop Compress’ Gamma with anything other than a grab attack, and lets Compress tank and walk through many problematic moves to get to safety.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch043_00.png" width="125"> | **Perception** <br>Highlighting enemies you melee is incredible for making sure they don't get away by weaving in and out of buildings or around obstacles. Compress already has a fantastic chase game, and Perception makes it even harder to escape him.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch017_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Technical** <br>Gives you an increase in reload speed every time your GP breaks. Allows you to get your Gamma back much quicker so you can run from or chase enemies more effectively. Combine with Plus Chaos for super fast reload speeds.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Only advisable if you're comfortable fighting early. Typically it will still be better to get Alpha to level 7 and then use this to get Gamma to level 9 faster. Since Compress is level dependent, getting additional cards can help him a lot in the early-mid game. You can also siphon any additional cards gotten to your teammates.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch034_00.png" width="125"> | **Reinforced Revive** <br>Compress can make decent use of this thanks to having an instant revive. Having to pick up your downed ally does make it harder to use though since you put yourself in harm's way to grab a teammate. Assess the situation before getting too greedy with this Tuning.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Strike** <br>Gives you an increase in attack power every time your GP breaks. Good for equalizing fights you start losing. Makes his combos and TOD hit harder. Combine with Plus Chaos for crazy damage.|
