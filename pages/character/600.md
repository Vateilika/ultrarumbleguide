Froppy or Tsuyu, is a rapid-class character with a wide range of playstyles suited to many different people. Your main objective is to find the balance between dealing damage and supporting your team through your revives, which may completely shift the tide of a battle. Due to her close range attacks as Beta and Melee, your job is to close distance quickly with the help of your mobility, and Alpha Skill. 

As one of the characters with the lowest HP pool in the game, you are an easy target and can be eliminated easily by many opponents. To counter this, you must make full use of your mobility - taking advantage of every movement option and your surroundings, controlling the space around you.

## Alpha Skill - Ribbit Shot
<p align="center">

</p>

Froppy’s Alpha Skill is an interesting and highly powerful ability. It features 2 modes: a projectile when used on the ground, and a grapple when used in mid-air.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/600a-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/600a2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

The projectile fires one single shot that will only hit an enemy if aimed directly at them, while still pulling you towards the target if you were in the air during the attack. When used in air, Froppy can grapple onto anything around her, giving her exceptional mobility and versatility in any situation, as well as the ability to close distance quickly.  

### When can you use ground Alpha and grapple Alpha?
Ground Alpha is usually paired with aim mode (right-click hold) and is best used from mid-long range, from high ground, or to hit opponents while they are in air. It functions like a snipe style attack and should only be used when your surroundings are relatively safe - don’t use mid-battle.  

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/600a3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

With Froppy, your gameplay revolves around staying in air and controlling your movement based on the situation. In most cases, you will be using aerial Alpha, allowing you to grapple toward opponents and shortening distance for close- range fights. You will have to evaluate when it’s safe to continue approaching - such as when an opponent is low HP - or when to change your trajectory mid-air and seek for a better moment to approach.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Value your ammo
At level 1, Froppy starts with 3 Alpha charges, which might seem sufficient at first glance. However, in a real match they run out quickly, especially when you’re traversing the map, chasing, running away or dodging enemy projectiles. 
Using your Alpha on the ground leaves you vulnerable for a second or two (the tongue needs time to fold back), giving enemies an opening to punish you. Missing an aerial Alpha is critically punishing - you will enter a stun like state, falling entirely to the ground, before you can jump again and attempt another grapple, while being left with 2 charges or less. 

When all 3 Alpha charges are spent, your mobility becomes extremely limited, and the skill takes a long time to fully recharge. Because of this, it’s usually best to keep at least one charge available. 

### Aim and improvisation  
After an Alpha is fired, it instantly connects with the enemy or pulls you toward a surface with no delay. Due to the terrain varying greatly on all 3 maps, it is important to learn how to quickly evaluate your surroundings, so you can choose the best grapple points and control your distance effectively. Froppy’s Alpha skill gains an increase in distance at levels 4, 7 and 9, with level 9 giving a noticeable range increase. Don’t hesitate to enter training mode and move around the map, trying different grapple options, testing range and practicing your aim as you play. Accept misses and constantly improve.

### Limitations
Although the Alpha Skill is powerful and versatile, its negative aspects are ineviatble. If you fire and the shot ends up out of range, you will enter the same short stun state until Froppy’s tongue returns, preventing you from using abilities during that time. Additionally, Alpha ability cannot pierce defensive abilities such as Momo’s shield, Kirishima’s beta and others. In that case, the tongue will hit the barrier, will not connect, and still take time to come back -  putting you into the stun state again.

## Beta Skill - Ribbit Swing
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch006_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Froppy's Beta Skill is a close-range fast tongue hit with 2 variants: Ground Beta and Air Beta. 

### Ground Beta
Ground Beta is a horizontal hit performed on the ground, going from right to left, and having a pretty large hitbox with some vertical reach above the ground. When hit, Ground Beta pushes the enemy away from you. Its direction can also be adjusted by your camera: if you look straight ahead, the attack will be straight; if you look upward, it will cover more aerial range; and if you look downward, it will reach more of the lower area beneath you.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/600b3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Beta
Air beta activates when used mid-air and does a vertical hit from top to bottom. When you are moving through the air, using Air Beta immediately stops your momentum and makes you start falling on the ground. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/600b4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

It can hit an enemy who is off-screen, as long as the tongue makes even a slight contact. Air Beta can be performed low on the ground as well, if Froppy is not touching the ground at all. Air Beta slams the opponent straight down on the ground, and the higher you hit from, the more they bounce off the ground upon landing, allowing you to perform another attack. 

### Stun of Air Beta
After bouncing off the ground, an opponent enters a brief stun window, which Froppy can immediately capitalize on. It allows you to follow up with a Ground Beta or Alpha for more damage. It will be talked about in the section “Combos” later. 

<p align="center">

</p>

### Limitations
Although Beta offers strong range, speed and both offensive and defensive potential, it still has unavoidable drawbacks. It does not function against defensive abilities such as Kirishima’s Beta or Momo’s Shield. When it hits these defenses, the Beta stops immediately, leaving Froppy in a roughly 1 second stun state that opponents can easily use to punish. 

Beta can also be dodged with good timing, unlike Alpha, which is much harder to avoid due to its instant travel speed. Always stay conscious of your surroundings, predict the moves of your opponents and choose the right moment to commit an attack.

### Overview
Beta Skill is a pretty fast ability, so missing it isn’t usually a major deal. Your job is to move fluidly around the battlefield, switching from one enemy to another as you attack. Beta is Froppy’s highest damage skill and is a key part in her DPS potential.

## Gamma Skill - Camofrog
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch006_Unique3.png" width="400" />
</p>
Froppy’s Gamma Skill turns her partly invisible, allowing to confuse your opponents, slip away from danger, or surprise attack. The invisibility ends the moment you use any other ability such as Alpha, Beta or Melee. Keep in mind that when invisible, your watery-like trace, healing items (GP and HP drinks), and card effects, like green heal aura from the support card, are visible to everyone - be careful.

### How to use it effectively?
The biggest strength of Gamma Skill is its buff to running speed and compatibility with Alpha. When timed correctly (use Gamma right as you build enough momentum in the air) it can give Froppy a small boost to her aerial momentum. Since Gamma Skill uses a percentage-based cooldown, it can be activated frequently, allowing you to repeat the process of grappling and boosting multiple times. When managed correctly, the ability becomes very helpful and extremely effective for mobility.

</p>

## Special Action - Froggy Catch
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch006.png" width="400" />
</p>
Froppy’s Special Action allows her to use her tongue to pull a downed ally toward her and immediately revive him. This ability is her strongest supportive tool that can change the state of a battle. 


### Revival Mechanics
To use it, you must face the ally directly, and the ability has very short range, meaning you need to stand fairly close to activate it. However, the revive is possible even if the ally is getting hit or is in the air, as long as Froppy stands on the ground. The revive happens instantly, but because Froppy has low HP, it’s important to save the ally quickly and then either retreat or assist the fight. The ability can be also paired with Gamma, allowing you to revive without enemies noticing you.

### Evaluation
Good Froppy players learn to evaluate whether reviving is actually reasonable and effective:
1. **Is the ally safe enough to survive after being revived?**<br>
    *If not, the revive only resets them to die again.*
2. **Can you revive manually instead?**<br>
    *If the situation allows, saving your Special Action and reviving normally is better.*
3. **Are there too many enemies on them?**<br>
    *If there is a strong full team or several, going in may get you killed, and the ally might get downed again instantly.*
4. **Is it okay to wait a second?**<br>
    *Sometimes, in the chaos of battle, your ally may survive for a few seconds, giving you time to finish healing or take out another enemy. Only attempt this if you are certain the ally is safe; otherwise, it’s usually best to go for the revive immediately.*
5. **Do you have Alpha charges left to escape afterward?**<br>
    *Never revive with zero mobility.*

Mastering this decision-making is key - the revive is instant, but its value depends on whether it actually benefits the team.

## Melees

Basic attacks are a crucial part of Froppy’s kit,and mastering  them can significantly improve your overall skill. Like all melees in the game,froppy has 2 types: Ground Melees and Air Melees

### Ground Melee


### Air Melee

</p>

## Leveling Paths
Froppy has several possible level-up paths to choose from. Before the August 20, 2025 buff, reaching Alpha level 4 was considered a standard due to its significant benefits and the difficulty of playing without it. Since then, playstyles and leveling paths started to vary among players. Here are the main ones we recommend.

### Option 1: Balanced and Strong
<p align="left">

    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Arrow.png" width="45" />
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Y9.png" width="45" />
</p>
This path prioritizes early Alpha for mobility, followed by leveling Beta for damage. Reaching Alpha level 4 first gives a noticeable boost to grapple range and reload speed, removing one of Froppy’s biggest limitations at level 1 - movement capability. Beta at 9 maximizes her attack potential, increasing damage, range, and speed, making it effective for both offensive and defensive plays. Finishing Alpha to 9 further enhances mobility, letting Froppy reposition quickly, cover large distances and control the battlefield more effectively. This path is very balanced, leaning slightly toward a damage-focused Froppy.

### Option 2: Versatile
<p align="left">

    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Arrow.png" width="45" />
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/B9.png" width="45" />
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Arrow.png" width="45" />
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Y9.png" width="45" />
</p>
This path balances mobility and damage throughout the match. Alpha is leveled first to 4, providing needed range and reload speed for comfortable movement. Beta at 4 increases damage and adds 1 charge, enough to fight in early to mid game. Finishing Alpha and Beta to 9 maximizes both mobility and offensive potential, letting Froppy move quickly on long distances and deal significant damage. This path works well for players who want a versatile playstyle, combining aggressive attacks with mobility and team support.

### Option 3: Aggressive
<p align="left">
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/A9.png" width="45" />
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Arrow.png" width="45" />
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/B9.png" width="45" />
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Arrow.png" width="45" />
    <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Y9.png" width="45" />
</p>

This path prioritizes maxing Alpha first, then Beta. Players using this are commonly aggressive, relying on fast attacks, quick retreats, and high mobility to control fights. Alpha at 9 gives massive grapple range and reload speed, allowing Froppy to move rapidly across the battlefield, attack enemies, and reposition safely. Beta at 9 maximizes damage output, allowing her to deal significant offensive pressure on other players. These players often use hit-and-run strategy, using their movement to bully opponents and retreat before taking too much damage, while relying on teammates for support.
