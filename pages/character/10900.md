Present Mic is a high damage strike character with some of the highest DPS in the game, his gameplay is centered in absolutely melting the enemies from afar and upclose, using different tools to achieve this in each range, as well as the ability to apply a deafen debuff to impair the enemy's ability to hear their surroundings.

This is Present Mic's primary DPS tool and one of the best alphas in the game, it has an incredible range and deals outstanding DMG when paired with his Special Action. The damage of this ability decreases with distance, the farther away you are, the less damage it does, but in exchange, the projectile becomes bigger, so from upclose he does high DMG with a smaller projectile hitbox, while to far away targets he does less damage but it's easier to hit. Even then, he doesn't lose much damage at range, especially with his Special Action up.

## Beta Skill #1 - Loud Voice

Present Mic's beta skill (tap) is his primary combo starter and also benefits from his Special Action. It deals decently high DMG and stuns the enemy shortly, which acts as a setup for your high damage combos. It's also a very annoying skill, as it inflicts "Deafen" to the enemy, which makes them unable to hear anything except for a ringing noise, which can make it harder for them to accurately predict threats, as they won't be able to use sound to guess your position. It doesn't have insane range, but it does have more range than most people think. It also has the benefit of hitting around courners, as the object collision hitbox is smaller than the damaging hitbox.

When holding his beta skill, Present Mic will cast this variation instead, where he sends huge soundwaves that have outstanding range. It's a phenomenal 3rd party tool that has great zoning when combined with his Special Action, but it's also his most punishable move. There are several ways to use this ability, the best way to me is to third party, or use it for area denial with Special Action. If aimed properly it can down fleeing targets with exceptional range, can guardbreak a whole team if caught unaware, and can zone out long range characters, an incredibly valuable move that's either overused by novice players or underused by standard players.

## Gamma Skill - DJ Punch

By far the most valuable part of his kit, getting this to level 4 is absolutely essential. It is a powerful forward-lunging punch with the unique trait that increases damage if allies are DOWNd or KOd. The most obvious way to use this is in conjunction with the beta, BUT that is not the only way, albeit a bit rare you can air melee into this, it might not be generally worth it but if you need to finish someone off without using a beta or don’t have one, this can be a solution. The best way to use this move is obviously to either beta combo into it or reposition with it, as it is solid mobility that hits like a truck. Even tho it makes you glow, this move isn't armored. A trick you can do that can get you some extra KOs is to, if you hit this move raw, you can chain an alpha after if the opponent has no GP.

Present Mic's Special Action is a very good move that on one hand has a high skill ceiling with proper placement, but also highly rewards just chucking this at the enemy. The BoomBox will copy your sound-based moves, meaning that when using an alpha, a tap beta or a hold beta, the BoomBox will do the same, aiming at the position you're aiming at. This results in a high increase in damage, and what makes Present Mic a true menace. The device has an incredibly low health, most characters can break it in one hit, which is why, along with repositioning, he has 3 uses. Proper box placement is required to get good with Present Mic, high vantage points or behind enemy’s are the best, especially if they have a shield, this move almost completely negates Assault Kendo’s shield, as you can throw the BoomBox behind and have it shoot at her back while you shoot the front. Keep in mind that placement can't be tricky, because of enemies leaving the area, obstacles, or tricky terrain such as slopes, all which can make it difficult for their attacks to reach the enemy.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3-string combo chain.
<br>
Using the full melee chain is perfectly viable—it deals respectable damage and leaves opponents open for follow-ups. However, the third strike’s projectile is what truly makes her melee versatile, letting you punish enemies who think they’re safe at mid-range.
