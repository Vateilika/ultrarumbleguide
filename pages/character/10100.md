*Create sturdy platforms with cement! A fortress of protection keeps enemies at bay.*

Cementoss is one of My Hero Ultra Rumble's starter characters alongside **[Izuku Midoriya](https://ultrarumble.com/character/01)**, **[Ochaco Uraraka](https://ultrarumble.com/character/03)**, **[Mt. Lady](https://ultrarumble.com/character/100)**, **[Tomura Shigaraki](https://ultrarumble.com/character/15)** and **[Dabi](https://ultrarumble.com/character/17)**.
He is a unique Support character who can modify the battlefield; being a beast against any grounded characters but struggling when fighting high mobility and flying characters.

## Alpha Skill - Pillar Split

<p align="center">

</p>

Pillar Split is Cementoss's main form of damage, mobility, cover and movement. With this ability, Cementoss fires a cement ball that becomes a pillar on impact against a surface. Both the pillar and the initial cement ball projectile do damage, so to hit the full damage you should aim at the enemy's feet to hit both the cement and the pillar creation, as otherwise the cement ball goes through players, creating the pillar behind them, though this mostly applies when shooting at opponents that are in the same height level than you or above.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/cement2.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Up to **3** Alpha pillars can exist at the same time; trying to create a 4th one makes the oldest pillar break. This pillars will last around 30 seconds and greatly expand in size the more the skill is leveled up, almost doubling its initial size.

### Alpha: Building

One of the Alpha's main uses consists of building structures; when firing at your feet you will automatically ride the pillar, esential for his overall gameplay. The pillar can be piled up on virtually any surface, including itself, Beta and Gamma. It's one of the best forms of vertical mobility in the game and can even nullify entire characters. Pillars can be stacked up to 3 times due to the natural limit, resulting in different scenarios like safe healing, pulling a DOWNd ally from danger by throwing an alpha at them (or towering up with them) or creating quick cover in a fight, as some areas are pretty flat and empty, so Cementoss's pillars can be a lifesaver to heal in peace without being spotted.

</p>

**Creating Cover**

Cementoss can use both his **Beta Skill** and **Gamma Skill** on top of his pillars at any time, with both having their uses. 

- **Beta** can be used to create temporary cover and it's an excellent option to block line of sight against **Beamers** or characters with **high mobility**, however it will leave you uncovered from behind which other players can use to attack you. 

- **Gamma** creates a platform when used on top of a pillar and becomes an excellent way to block line of sight and expanding the surface area of your structure. It can be used to **revive teammates** from a high place that a lot of characters can't reach or shoot through and also healing. However it does come with some weaknesses, such as being very open to attacks from characters who **can** get above you and, while it does block line of sight, most opponents will know where to look for you on top of your pillar if you use a gamma to top it off.

- **Both** Beta and Gamma can be used one after another to get the best of both worlds. To do this, just pile 3 Alpha Pillars, create a Gamma Slab and finally create a horizontal Beta barrier. This will give you both Beta and Gamma's benefits: a big surface area on your tower with a temporary cover, both blocking line of sight. But this method also inherits their weaknesses, making you vulnerable to attacks from behind and easily located.

### Alpha: Blockage

Due to the Alpha pillar size, it's one of the best methods to block passages and entrances in My Hero Ultra Rumble. Since the pillar can be created in almost every surface blocking is very easy and rewarding to perform. Furthermore, Alpha pillars are resistant and will take many hits from the enemy to break. While this is often recomended, full teams or certain skills like charged **[All For One's](https://ultrarumble.com/character/16)** Alpha can break the pillar fast.

</p>

## Beta Skill - Load-Bearing Wall 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch101_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

When activated, this skill will create a cement wall in front of you at your aim's direction. The cement wall will only pop up once Cementoss is touching a surface, so activating in the air will make him fast fall until he lands on one. This Skill is the most damaging move of his kit.

### Molding

Beta can be molded by using various inputs as its being built (if no input is given the wall will default to a vertical wall):

**Basic**: holding the left or right input will create a horizontal wall, while holding forward will create a vertical wall. 

**Mixed**: by inputting forward and then either left or right the wall will be created in a "T" shape. If you switch the order, the wall will become a "U" shape instead.

**Exceptional**: if there is an object blocking the wall from going horizontally on one side, holding any side input will make it be created on the opposite direction.

</p>

## Gamma Skill - Structural Slab
<p align="center">

</p>

Launches a blob of cement which forms a slab on impact. Both the projectile and slab deal damage, with the projectile flinching on hit. This skill is a great combo tool thanks to the flinch effect, aswell as an alternative mobility tool: if used in the air, Cementoss will get launched in the opposite direction of where he’s facing. This technique can be improved further by performing it on jumping wakeup towards the ground, which will launch you into the air, leading to escaping or combos.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/cement11.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Gamma is also often used as a structure element (finishing off Alpha towers as we saw previously) and damage tool. 
While it can be used to block passages, it isn't recommended since it isn't as practical as Alpha or Beta blocking.

## Special Action - Defensive Wall
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch101.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Revives a downed teammate, forming a concrete box around them. This skill can go through walls but has a limited range, only 1 charge and can't be activated in the air. It's a very powerful skill but can be tricky and situational to use.
Some noteworthy interactions:

- If the downed ally is falling at the same time you use Special Action on them, they will spawn under the concrete box.

- There is a bug that makes the concrete box spawn around yourself instead of your ally, although what causes it is currently unknown with some believing it might be caused by lag and/or pressing the Special Action button at the same time as you land.


## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3 hit combo in which Cementoss does 2 slaps for 20 damage followed by a series of repeated strikes, hitting for around 110 to 120 in total. While it is a decent combo tool, Ground Melee is hard to reliably use due to Cementoss' knockback and how short range it is. Where Cementoss' Melee shines is in breaking his own structures: Cementoss' Pillars have a unique property that is shared among other characters who can generate structures aswell, being that he can break his own structures very quickly meanwhile both allies and enemies require a big amount of hits. Ground melee requires all 3 hits of the move to break a structure at all levels. 

**Air Melee**<br>
Air melee consists on an uppercut which hits for 65 damage. Air melee is easier to use than his regular Melee due to the versatile nature of air melees, but also due to the fact that you can use this move while dropping from Pillars. Similar to his Grounded Melee, Cementoss can break his own structures with this move, taking only 1 hit for all structures under Level 9 and 2 for this last one.

## Leveling Paths

**The Basic:** this is the most common Levelling Path for Cementoss. It consists on levelling up Alpha to Level 9, followed up by  levelling up Gamma to this same level, leaving Beta for last. This route is based on mobility and will give Cementoss various movement options aswell as a lot of ranged attacks, at the price of not having a reliable big damaging move.

     <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/B9.png" width="45"/>
</p>

**The Striker**: this is the least common Cementoss levelling path and it consists on levelling up Alpha all the way up to 9, and then level up Beta to 9, levelling up Gamma last. With this method Cementoss will have his primary tool at maximum power, size and charges, aswell as a very powerful and damaging attack, at the cost of less mobility and building options.

</p>

**The Belligerent**: this path is often used when Cementoss are forced to fight in earlier game. Since Cementoss is a level dependant character (weak early game, really strong late game), this is the most optimal route if you want to have a chance at fighting. This path will make his Alpha and Beta reach the sweet spot between Weak and Really Strong (Level 4) leaving him with decent movement and attack options. After reaching those sweet spots you can keep levelling up following **The Striker** path.

</p>

**Something to note**

All of these levelling paths have something in common: they always level up the Alpha Skill first. Reason being that this move is Cementoss' most important one. It's his movement, attack, cover, structure move,... While you technically *can* play without using Alpha, it's the move that makes Cementoss Cementoss. We STRONGLY recommend to always prioritize this move.

## Techs

**Walk Cancelling**

Walk cancelling is a must learn tech that reduces endlag on all moves and is required for some combos and mixups. It involves moving back and forth or in a circle during quirk usage in order to reduce frames for certain moves. This can be done by moving your joystick in a semicircle on console or pressing a/d quickly on pc. Some good uses of this are: Pillaring, Beta cancelling, Gamma combos and some alpha combos.

**Alpha Shelfing**

"Shelfing" consists in placing an Alpha Pillar infront of you on a Pillar Tower without riding it, giving the illusion of being on top of it while you are actually hiding behind it. This is most often used for healing and can be done just by throwing an Alpha Pillar at the corner of the previous one you are standing on and then walking off onto the "shelf". Most enemies won't know to look for a Cementoss healing on a Shelfed Pillar however you are still very visible from behind. Shelfed pillars can also be used in tandem with beta in order to hit the ground from max pillar height. Beta travels down shelfs when at level 9 and can be used on people trying to climb up or people at the base of your pillar.

**Alpha Pushing**



**Beta Elevator**

Beta elevator is a tech that can be used in order to gain height mid fight, an alternative to pillaring. It can be done just by looking up and using your beta. This is best done at level 9 (thanks to the size). Enemies often don’t expect this Tech due to how fast it is and the fact that you can hit them with the Beta at the same time as this is done.

Unfortunately this Tech cannot be done on the Nintendo Switch version due to framerate limitations.

**Wall Techs**

Both Gamma and Alpha are useful for hitting opponents through walls, however gamma is the most reliable for this by far. Placing gamma anywhere near a wall without letting the projectile itself hit it will create the slab indoors, ignoring all objects. This can be useful for stopping healing, reviving, or can simply be used if you trap an opponent indoors and the room is small enough. With the size increasing at level 4 and 9, it is easier and more effective to hit opponents the higher the level of your Gamma. Alpha can also be used for hitting indoors however it can only hit if the opponent is directly against it due to how much smaller the alpha hitbox is compared to Gamma's.
Beta can also be used to hit through walls, yet it won’t actually create the beta on the other side and only the initial section will deal damage before disappearing on spawn.  Additionally, this only works on thin walls like glass or temporary structures, and only works if both you and the opponent are directly against the wall.
