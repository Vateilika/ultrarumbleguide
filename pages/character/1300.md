Shota Aizawa is a character specialized in husband energy and mid-range old-school rizz. By using his biinding cloth, he achieves powerful connection between him and his target, inflicting the "Enamour" status effect. It is important to play around this effect, as it is his biggest combo enabler. Combined with his "Sussy Eyes" Special Action, he can kill deal insane amounts of Steven DMG to Gran Torino.<br>

This ability has two variations: Ground Version and Air Version.

**Ground Version**</br>
This ability allows you to shoot a binding cloth which can bind the enemy, making them stun locked. This move can be used with and without an input, if you press again you will pull your enemy faster. Most people don't use it, but it saves time, unless you wish to bind them for a longer period, in which case don't press any buttons after the move lands. This ability also has potential for team combos.

</p>

**Air Version**</br>
Triggered by hitting an opponent or a solid surface while mid-air. Another version of the move used for both mobility and offense. This variation allows Aizawa to propel himself towards the target with a kick while stun-locking them, dealing damage. If there's a non-ceiling surface close enough, or if the binding cloth hits a solid surface, then the kick will impact the surface and he will bounce off, creating a shockwave that does additional damage.<br>

</p>
<br>
Hitting a flying target or ceiling will cause Aizawa to be pulled in that direction without bouncing off, useful for escaping, however he will not deal shockwave damage, this is why this move deals the most damage on ground opponents. After bouncing, you can follow up with a gamma, though not really recommended. Instead, you can follow up with another alpha, as bouncing around can make you more agile and harder to hit by the opponent's teammates or any third parties. Additionally, you choose the direction you will bounce off to by simply pressing a direction input.

## Beta Skill - Powerhouse Barrage Kick

</p>
A simple rapid kick dash. This ability is slow and deals low damage that often struggles to connect all hits with, for this reason, it's the lowest priority when it comes to leveling your skills. This ability's strongest offensive value is against corners, especially if you catch them mid-air, since the skill's low downpower allows you to go for two betas in a row, but outside of this, you don't really want to use beta offensively.

</p>

Beta's main use is as a mobility tool, because even though it's slow and does not take you as far as alpha, it requires no solid surfaces and helps with getting on top of buildings, since alpha alone can't take you on top of a building most of the time, due to the fact it pulls you towards the location you hit rather than above it, but with the help of beta, this isn't an issue.

## Gamma Skill - Binding Cloth: Serpent

Gamma is Aizawa's most damaging move. This ability is often used as a follow-up to ground alpha, and it has the upside of blocking projectiles it comes in contact with, meaning you can damage an opponent and block projectiles coming at you, as well as skills such as Strike Shigaraki's alpha and beta. This ability however keeps him locked in place, and the projectile blocking property only applies to those that come from the front, he's vulnerable from behind. Using this ability mid-air will expand the projectile-blocking area below you and allow you to float while casting it. Gamma can also be used against an opponent who is very close but not close enough for melee, and it traps opponents very decently if used well in tight spaces, buildings, corners and such, it's especially useful if they don't use their invincibility frames. Careful not to land the move prematurely or they will escape. This move has strange hitboxes at the back of it and on the sides, as it occasionally hits the opponent before the full execution of the move. Additionally, since htis move keeps enemies stunned in place, it's useful for quick team combos.

## Special Action - Erasure

</p>
An ability that applies a -10% DMG and -20% Defense debuff. This is a really good option for calling out wake-ups since it has pretty similar tracking to melee 3. The defense debuff is extremely good for scaring someone into leaving you alone, making his combos even scarier or working with your team to just annihilate the debuffed target. Jump Special Action is a solid option for calling out someone who's going to jump and press an escape tool on wake-up as well if you know they'll go for that.

Touching a construct with it will immediately destroy them in one hit, which can be useful when dealing with Cementoss's pillars and other obstacles, including natural-generating ones like the buildings in USJ's collapse zone. It can also be used twice in a quick succession while midair for extra mobility.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3-string combo chain. It's a good option for calling out wake-ups and to just start getting damage up close without using a skill since it does 120 damage. The lunge of melee 3 also has really good tracking so you can just abuse that against someone in close range trying to dodge roll spam if they're close enough.

</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
Shigaraki's air melee is an okay aerial callout option, but is pretty much outclassed and overshadowed by aerial Special Action due to that having better tracking, doing more damage, lowering the targets defense and attack, and sometimes being a better combo starter if you're high enough in the air. It's solid for starting ground combos if they're on shield or you landed it close enough to the ground while they're on HP to follow up with melee 1.
