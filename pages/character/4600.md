Itsuka Kendo is an assault character who excels at pumping damage and control. While she can hit hard, she isn’t a pure brawler who can recklessly push into every fight alone. Kendo thrives as a team-oriented fighter, using her shield, and punishes to create openings and protect her allies.
She is especially effective at punishing careless enemies who underestimate her due to her limited mobility. Assault Kendo has a lot of technical depth, with many mechanics and techs that reward players who master her full kit. However, because she lacks strong movement options, positioning is extremely important when playing Kendo - holding good ground is often the key to surviving and winning fights.

## Alpha Skill - Stone-throwing Fist

<p align="center">

</p>

Kendo’s Alpha skill is similar to the Alpha skills of beam-type characters such as Izuku Midoriya or Bakugo. It deals high damage at close range and its effectiveness varies with distance, depending on the opponent’s position. The skill has decent range and functions much like a shotgun blast.

It’s a straightforward ability — if your aim is solid, you’ll have little to worry about when using it. However, avoid using it like a typical beamer’s attack from long range against another beamer, as you’ll likely lose the trade.

Both the aimed and unaimed versions have the same effect; it simply comes down to whether or not you prefer to aim. There’s no functional difference between the two.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch046_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Beta skill is what sets her apart from the rest of the cast due to its strong punish potential. Using Beta, you can punish opponents who hit the shield because any physical attacks that lands on your shield they get stopped and staggered making it easier to land your gamma or melee chains, or use it to block incoming projectiles. How effectively you can block and punish depends on your experience and reaction time. Over time, you’ll develop a sense of when to use the shield and when to drop it.

Beta cannot always be used reactively, unlike its Strike counterpart. Keep in mind that you’re still vulnerable to attacks from behind, from the ground, and from wide-area effects. Enemies can also walk through the shield — if they do, they can hit you directly. You can punish these situations using your Melee, Alpha, or Gamma skills.

The punish options differ depending on the situation. For example, if an opponent hits your shield while in the air, you should almost always punish with Gamma, since most of your melee hits will miss. On the other hand, when punishing grounded opponents, you should ideally use melee attacks or short combos for the best results.

</p>

## Gamma Skill - Big Fist Grip
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch046_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Gamma skill allows her to lunge forward and deliver a powerful clap that deals solid damage. It has some of the best armor in the game and can be used to punish almost any opponent. However, be cautious when using it against players who understand how to fight Kendo — they can bait out your Beta or Gamma and punish you after dodging.

Your Gamma and melee attacks are your primary punishing tools, so try to use Gamma only when you’re confident the enemy won’t evade it. You can also use this skill to gain a bit of extra movement.

</p>

## Special Action - Big Fist Carry
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch046.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Special Action allows her to carry an ally with her enlarged hand. This is a great team ability, as it lets you throw your teammates across the map. For example, you can use it to reposition a character with limited mobility, such as Momo Yaoyorozu, or to help a low-HP teammate escape.

However, keep in mind that during your Special Action, you cannot attack. This leaves you vulnerable, so be aware of nearby enemies who can easily punish you while you’re stationary and unable to fight back.

You can also use this ability offensively — for instance, by throwing a teammate forward to quickly chase down an enemy. Once thrown, your teammate can immediately use their mobility skills to follow up. Technically, allies can still attack while being carried without dismounting, but this has limited utility and is mostly for fun. Certain attacks that root the user in place, such as Ibara’s moves, will cause the carried player to dismount.

Interestingly, a Hawks player can even carry a Kendo who’s carrying another teammate.

</p>


## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 4-string combo with a strong lunge when you're close to the opponent. This can be used as an alternative to Beta when Gamma is too slow against faster characters such as Iida, Rapid Deku, or Rapid All Might. You can also choose not to complete the full melee chain and instead interrupt it midway to mix in another skill, such as Alpha or Gamma. Be cautious when using melee attacks, as you’ll be vulnerable to other enemies while performing them. (See more in the combo section.)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4600m-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Kendo jumps and lunges forward enlarging her hand for a big hit. You can land two air melees before the knockback for a combo with any of your skill depending on where you are. You can mix your combos between melees and skills, more onto that in the combo section.

## Leveling Paths
### Hybrid Path: Alpha
A path for players who want to use their alpha. Ideally you also want Beta 4 for easier punished and Gamma 9 afterwards. The downside however is that your gamma will be low level so you need experience before you start leveling alpha first.

</p>

### Punish Path
For players that want to play Kendo as a punish character or if you don't feel like aiming. The only downside is that your alpha will be low level. This is the recommended path for newer Kendo players.

</p>

### Support Path
For players who want to play Kendo as a support. Level Beta to max level first, then you can branch into one the paths above.

</p>

## Techs
### Air Extension: Shield
If can cancel Kendo's beta skill midair with alpha, you will keep your aerial momentum, essentially letting you move faster. This works very well when it comes to chasing since you can attack at the same time you keep yourself fast.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Itsuka Kendo's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 25 DP (Per rock), 100 DP (Full Hit)<br>
Beta Skill: - DP<br>
Gamma Skill: 500 DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3-4: 100 DP (Individually), 400 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP (Presumably 250)<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 -> Melee 4 -> Alpha
A combo that takes advantage of melee's 400 total downpower to sneak in an extra alpha. This combo is only fully possible if the target is on HP before using alpha or against a corner, otherwise the alpha will either miss or do very little damage. Special tunes such as Acceleration make this combo work on GP.

</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 -> Melee 4 -> Gamma

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Since Kendo lacks a bit of mobility you can use wall runner to compensate the lack of mobility. It also removes the need of collecting various cards such as technical and rapid cards.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Kendo's melee is good, you can use embrittlement to amplify your damage. You can activate it using any sort of melees, pretty self explanatory. It also allows your teammates to deal more damage to the enemy you've struck.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>A solid option that makes Kendo speedy and makes it basically impossible to dodge her alphas.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Since Kendo does a lot of damage, you can use fixer to do even more damage with the right build and the right slots. If you can pair this with Embrittlement you've got yourself some absurd damage.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Rapid** <br>A budget alternative to Wall Runner that works well for very specific builds.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch105_00.png" width="125"> | **Trance Blow** <br>Trance blow can be used to slow enemies using your melee to do insane damage, however depending on character and chaos around you it can backfire.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Recommended tuning for somewhat experienced Kendos, more levels are always good, especially if you can KO people easily.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>Recommended for experienced Kendos who can KO people easily, getting PU per KO always helps you get away from situations where you would not be able to otherwise.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_00.png" width="125"> | **Symbol of Peace** <br>Useful for extra survivability, especially in the early game.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>This tuning works with every character, as surviving lethal attacks with 1 HP is always useful. However, you gotta be wise with how you use your i-frames, Kendo's mobility is quite low, so this tune will only delay your death if you don't play wisely.
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Strike** <br>Since Kendo does absurd damage, revenge strike will always work with her. Getting a damage boost upon being guardbroken is nice.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch101_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Support** <br>Heals you when guardbroken, this tuning is useful if you like using the Poison Mist to your advantage. This tuning is very specific and useful, recommended for newer Kendo players.|

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Assault Deku can outrange you with his alpha, but you can outdamage the deku upclose, both Deku and Kendo have equal mobility, however Deku can use his blackwhip to help him outrange you and get away from you. Assault Deku match-up is pretty much even, it really depends on what you and the Deku does, what you have is more damage while Deku has a tiny bit more movement, you can use your damage and melee to your advantage to win this match-up.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Pretty much same thing as Assault Deku, however on this match-up your best bet to win is melee and gamma hits, both Kendo and Deku have the same amount of damage pretty much speaking, however one thing to watch out for in this match-up is Full Bullet's gamma, the rest is pretty much same as Assault Deku match-up.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Deku’s continued mastery of One For All is making him harder and harder to compete against when on Compress. While his grounded Alpha is easy to reflect thanks to its long wind-up, and his aerial Alpha is fairly easy to stop too, that's about where the positives end for Compress. OFA Deku is highly mobile and has great tools to get in and pressure you in close range. His melee armor will prevent you from stunning him yourself, so you really have no way to prevent him from going into Overdrive. Once in Overdrive his movement and close range expertise will become even more oppressive. In a one on one, the only opportunities you’ll have to punish OFA Deku is when he first activates either his Gamma, or his Special Action Fa Jin. If he activates his Special Action Smoke Screen prior to this however, it’ll be very hard to punish him with your Alphas stun. Alternatively, if you’re in a bigger fight look to wail on him while he’s performing melee’s on another player, as he’ll be stuck for a brief window finishing the animation. While you do have good movement to get away from this engagement, OFA Deku can do a decent job of catching up to you, or could even use the tracking on his Gamma to knock you out of the sky. If possible, it's best to try and use Gamma from behind cover to mitigate the chance he locks on to you.

Both of you guys have insane damage and both of you are practically the same character, however the match-up rules are pretty much same as fighting an Assault Deku. One thing you can do different on this match-up is blocking the gamma and catch his Special Action.

On this match one thing u gotta watch for is the knee air melee from Ochako and Gamma, the rest depends on what Ochaco you face and what you can do. However on this match-up you may need few a few rapid cards to kill her.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While you can block everything an Iida does, because of his speed it's difficult to deal with everything, and even punish a good Iida, it depends on you skill and how good you are at punishing. This match-up can be both even 🟡 or 🔴 unfavorable depending on your and Iida's skill, however one thing you must do on this match-up is punish a burnt iida.<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Both you and Shoto are close range demons with insane damage, however on this match-up you gotta be careful to not get hit by his beta and his gamma whenever you can. Same rule as fighting an Assault Deku pretty much besides that.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
You counter everything Shoto does... literally. You can block his gamma, his beta and his alpha. Everything he does you can counter it using your shield, however one thing you gotta be careful on this match-up is to not get frozen during his alpha, besides that this matchup is very very favorable for kendo.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
This matchup is very favorable for Kendo, if you see a Froppy coming your way you can use your alpha, and if she comes very close, you can even use your melee to stall Froppy close to you, just use your melee properly on this matchup and Froppy can never touch you.

This match-up is very easy for Kendo, as you can block everything except for gamma, which is the only thing you gotta watch for in this match-up, besides that this matchup depends on how good on you are at blocking and dodging.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
This match-up can be even 🟡 depending on the player, both of you have armored gamma, however the biggest difference in this matchup is that Kirishima can use his armored move in the air, and that's a game changer in this match, and also the fact that Kirishima has a better shield and combo than yours while also having similar melees. Red Drive also outdamages you while having largely more movement then you do. This match-up is all about who punishes and uses shield properly.

Both of you have insane damage, both Denki and Kendo have practically the same movement, both Denki and Kendo are practically the same character, however one thing you gotta watch out for in this match-up is that you don't wanna get stunned as it means death or sometimes being very low after his combo, you gotta use melees beta and alphas properly on this match-up while avoiding getting stunned by Denki.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
This match-up is very favorable to you, however if you see a Denki sniping above a building don't get greedy, let him come to you instead, both of you have similar combos, his stun combos don't hurt as much as his default counterpart, upclose you outdamage him by a lot, and he cannot do too much to you while you also have your armored gamma. On this match-up, one thing you should watch for is his gamma, just don't let Denki get away whenever he tries to by using melee or gamma.

It's Monoma he can do everything you do but better, with infinite movement you have to be really good with melees and your skills to kill good Monomas as they have no CDs. There's not much to say he's just Monoma, however you can use your combos to kill him quickly, as he has low HP.

This match-up is unfavorable to you simply because Strike kendo has way more movement than you, however you can win this matchup by blocking the Kendo's beta and gamma to punish her, same thing for the melee. Both of you have equal shield however there is one advantage you have with your shield, that is you can block forever while she cannot. This matchup can be 🟡 Even. Depending on your opponent it can be Unfavorable or Even, just remember to never get caught by the melees, beta and gamma while playing on Kendo's mistakes.

This match-up is even for Kendo as she can outdamage an ibara upclose, however on this match-up what you gotta watch for is to never fight an Ibara long range, as Ibara counters Kendo at this distance thanks to her alphas special piercing property. However, you counter Ibara upclose.

This match-up is very favorable to Kendo as she can punish everything a Nejire does while having insane damage. Nejire cannot do too much to you no matter where Nejire is as long as you have a few rapid cards in your inventory. However, while grounded, one thing you gotta watch for in this match-up is Nejire's gamma as it can hurt Kendo a lot and can ruin your momentum, besides that this match-up is all about using your rapid cards properly to kill a Nejire, she cannot do much to you because your gamma counters Nejire pretty hard, even if Nejire is in the air one gamma pretty much counters her, recovering or not.

This match-up is self explanatory, never let Shinso learn and punish him upclose as he can't do much at that range.

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While All Might’s Alpha can be reflected like most others, you may be surprised to learn you can even block the splash damage from it with your Beta as well. All Might's Beta will be his best tool against you on Compress, as if you don’t recover quick enough after being hit, it can be combo’d into a second Beta or into a ton of Alphas. For this reason if you're hit by it, recover as fast as possible, but let your i-frames run out so you can’t be hit by any subsequent moves, especially that second Beta. If you start reflecting Alphas, this is most likely the move he’ll use in response, so get ready to dodge it. All Might's Gamma isn't too strong, and is mostly used as a way to stall since you can’t hit him while he’s in it. Typically All Might players will use his Special Action leap after exiting this to run, so be ready to quickly wail on him with Alphas while he crouches and then keep chase with your Gamma. This should fortunately be quite easy, as although All Might has decent movement Compress’ is still superior. If he chooses to use his Betas to get more distance it also means his best move in this fight will be gone, so keep track of how many charges he uses when moving around.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Gatlings Alpha is just about one of the easiest Beta reflection targets in the entire game. Its long start up before it starts dealing big damage will give you ample time to begin reflecting it with your Beta. If he tries to use his uncharged Beta, you can also reflect that to stun him and start potential Combos. Holding your Beta out will likely bait him into going for one of his two most dangerous moves in this match up, his charged Beta, or his Gamma. His Gamma is especially damaging, and can grab you out of your own Gamma, so be on the lookout for it. If he misses his Gamma his recovery is quite punishable, allowing you to spam your Alpha against him. Although Gatlings movement is a little better than default All Might’s, escape or chase still shouldn’t be a primary concern for Compress here. 
<br>

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
While Aizawa’s Alpha can be blocked by your Beta, often allowing you to squeeze an Alpha in between his attempts to grab you, his damage potential and reliable counter to your whole kit easily gives Aizawa the upper hand. When you throw your Alpha in between his attempts to grab you really have to try and aim for a stun or else he can spam his own Alpha to try and start his high damage combos. Aizawa can also easily close distance and dart around you using his aerial Alpha and Beta, making him very hard to hit. Aizawas Gamma is a hard move to fight when on Compress, as its ability to block all shots from his front and sides means you’ll have to be behind him to get a hit on him. If you're able to get the opportunity to attack his exposed behind however he’ll be stuck losing a lot of health. Aizawa's Special Action is unsurprisingly a huge counter against Compress, as not only does it allow for an easy attempt of his grounded Alpha with you not being able to block or fight back, but if you’re in your Gamma’s marble and become affected by it, you’ll be kicked out which ruins your momentum. Finding a good moment to use your Gamma in this fight can already be hard as well, as the pause before your teleport sets him up for an easy grab if you aren't careful. Aizawa's movement is nothing to scoff at either, being able to make good ground regardless if he's running from or chasing you.
<br>

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Like when fighting most Alpha spam characters, an easy get around to a trigger happy Mic will be to reflect his Alpha with your Beta. This is especially important to do in this match up, as thanks to his Special Action Present Mics Alpha can easily stack up damage even faster than normal. Mic does have some counterplay here, as throwing his radio behind you will let it hit you since your back is turned to it. In close quarters Present Mic players will often go for his easy tap Beta into Gamma combo. If he starts with Beta you can actually block this and attempt to dodge his Gamma after or start stunning him if you're quick. Be careful if he expects this though, as if he does just Gamma he’ll punch you straight through your barrier. If you ever dodge his Gamma, its end lag gives you a good punish opportunity, or gives you time to Gamma away if you're in a bad spot. Just like his tap Beta, you can also block his charged Beta, which shouldn’t be too difficult as its long start up gives ample time for you to put up your Beta. In the event he does knock you down, watch for his tap Beta, as its stun will stop you from teleporting on wake up. In terms of movement, Mic is very outclassed against Compress, and you shouldn’t struggle to run or catch up to him.
<br>

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Despite his unique playstyle Cementoss will normally be a good match up for Compress. Both his Alpha and Gamma can be reflected while still in midair, meaning his combo game against Compress is much more limited as it relies on the stun from direct hits for max damage. If you're hit by Alpha or Gamma, recover/roll as fast as possible to try and prevent a follow up attack. Cementoss is great at creating his artificial high ground for both vertical movement and to create a safe spot to heal. Compress’ Gamma is an excellent counter to this however, as it can easily get you above Cementoss to rain Alphas on him. Watch for if he places a Gamma on top however, as it’ll block you from getting above him if you’re too close to the pillar. If he doesn't stack his pillars high enough  you actually won’t need Gamma at all, as simply throwing Alphas from the ground can still let you hit him thanks to the marble's arc and the projectile size. While this primarily covers the counter play outside, fighting Cementoss inside is not advised unless you already have a considerable advantage. His ability to block your exits combined with the fact his moves are super easy to hit inside, will put you at a big disadvantage. 
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Endeavor struggles quite a bit in this match up. His Alpha, while capable of high damage if you aren't careful, is very easy to block and you can react to it after he gets a tick or two worth of hits. His Beta will be his most threatening move thanks to its very high damage, so reflecting it is instrumental in stopping Endeavor's offense. It does offer counterplay against your Beta though, as once it lands on a surface the pillar it makes can’t be blocked anymore. His Gamma is also not blockable. If he misses it or you catch an Endeavor using it against someone else however, him being stuck in the air gives you an excellent opportunity to spam Alphas into him. In the event he knocks you down, try to find cover before using Gamma to get away. Otherwise the pause before the teleport makes you an easy Beta target. The movement granted by Endeavor’s Special Action is far outclassed by Compress’ Gamma.
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Much like with Strike Endeavor, Inferno Fist’s Beta is the move you’ll want to watch for. Its spawn AOE and ability to drag you back inside can make for a lethal trap, so it's best to just Gamma out in most situations. If Inferno Fist tries to melt you with Alphas while you're stuck, reflect them with your Beta until he stops before you use Gamma to discourage him from following. If he tries to use his Gamma, teleport instantly to avoid it. In the event you don’t have Gamma available, you can reflect his Gamma too, but only while it's airborne. Once it hits the ground you’ll need to run. If you're ever in the open holding your Beta against him, be aware you’re an easy target for his Beta and that you’ll need to watch for it. His movement is the same as his base, so still not great.
<br>

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Hawks only really has one good move in this match up and that is his Beta. Its near guaranteed shield break and being a super easy method to knock you down already make it great. The additional movement on hit it provides him is the cherry on top though, as Hawks become much harder to hit with his increased speed and can easily follow up on you. If he misses his first Beta it is easy to punish however. His slow moving auto-track Alpha sucks, and will do very little damage before you can react and block it. A Hawks who can quickly beam with the aimed version before moving again is much harder to react to. His Gamma is easy to dodge and reflectable too, so make sure to attempt the reflect whenever you see him do his spin. Even with his nerfs his movement is nothing to scoff at, and if you get outlined by his Gamma you may have difficulty running away.
<br>

## Hawks (Slicing Wind) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch043var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Much like the base Battle Style for Hawks, Slicing Wind only really has one truly problematic move for Compress in his Gamma. Its combo potential, and large hitbox make it very dangerous if you can’t avoid it. Try and recover as quickly as possible to prevent follow ups if you're hit by this attack. Like most Alpha’s, Slicing Wind is reflected right back at him, so watch for him so you can return to sender. His Beta is sort of an awkward move to characterize. While it is damaging if he lands it, it can be dodged fairly easily and leaves him very open to punish if he misses. Its best use against Compress will be to use it to break out of combos, as at level 7 it can break through the effects of stuns, countering Compress’ Alpha. His movement is quite good too, so it may be difficult to run from or catch up to Slicing Wind if he has his cooldowns.
<br>

## Mt Lady <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch100/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch100_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Mt. Lady is an excellent close range fighter, and ideally someone you want to interact with from a nice middleground. This highly limits her damage options and forces her to make a play to try and get in which you can predict, or spam her Alpha which you can reflect. Highground is ideal though as it's much harder for her to reach and she wastes moves to get up. If Mt Lady ever gets too close to you, you should try and Gamma away since that's where she excels. Do be careful though, as her stomps can stun you out of it. If she ever knocks you down her Beta will be her best wake up catch option, so avoid that as best as possible. Her movement is quite poor, so you’ll outclass her there. Her giant form isn’t particularly bad unless you're right beside her making you an easy target. Her Alpha is incredibly easy to reflect thanks to its slow speed, and her Beta is easily dodged by teleporting into the air. Her Gamma will be the only real threat as its huge hitbox means you aren't safe in the sky. If she ever enters this mode, try your best to disengage as fast as possible, as her huge damage reduction and insane damage make winning a fight almost impossible if she's even kind of healthy. 

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Unfortunately for Shigiraki he really struggles to do much to Compress. His Alpha and Beta being grounded when Compress can easily fly into the air or get high ground with his Gamma means he lacks the ability to deal consistent damage to you. His Alpha also leaves him open to a counter attack since he's stationary using it. Even when you don’t have Gamma available, jumping over and over to stay off the ground until you get it back will negate some damage. You do need to keep in mind his Alpha and Beta can travel up surfaces though, so you aren't entirely safe when you are on top of buildings. If Shigiraki tries to Gamma you, dodge towards him so he runs right past you. It’ll grab you through your Gamma’s armor so using it won’t be a safe option to get away. If he does land it recover as fast as possible or else he may be able to hit his Special Action after to inflict Defense Down on you. His Gamma and Special Action being his movement sources means you won’t struggle to run or catch up to him. Shigi really isn't scary unless you’re in a small final circle or inside a building with him. Try and avoid those situations and he shouldn't be an issue.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Catastrophe is another character utilizing stuns like Compress. While you can reflect both his Alpha and Beta, he can easily get around this by throwing them at the ground instead to damage you. This means you’ll have to be smart using it, as just holding it out will invite unwanted damage while you do nothing back to him. If he's close to you Catastrophe can also go for his Gamma instead, allowing him to start his combos. If you’re ever hit by one of these combos you’ll also be taking a ton of damage which’ll force you to flee. Fortunately he isn’t too good at catching your wake up or stopping your Gamma. The best thing to try and do in this match up is just get the stun on him first if you're close, or stay above him and rain down your Alpha. Fortunately your Gamma is great movement against Catastrophe, so he can’t outrun or chase you well.

## All For One (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch016_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
When it comes to AFO’s base kit you’ll be having quite a back and forth match up. Like all Alphas if AFO spams it against you it’ll be very easy to reflect it back. You can reflect the charged version too, and thanks to its slow movement speed you can actually walk into its path on missed shots to ensure it's reflected. His Beta will be his counter to you, as it's quite large and can’t be reflected or blocked. Its ability to go through walls also gives AFO an option to stop you from following him in or out of buildings. His Gamma is a very back and forth move here. Dodging this move leaves AFO wide open to a counter attack or it’ll allow you an opportunity to escape him. Its lack of Armor also means you can stun him out of it if you're close enough. Mistiming a dodge however gives AFO a free combo which is almost guaranteed to do huge damage. This move also can’t be dodged while you’re in the air, which is a problem for Compress since he’s in it so often thanks to his Gamma. When approaching AFO or using Gamma in an area you know one is in, try when possible to make sure he’s already used his Gamma so you won’t be caught in it while airborne. His base kit doesn't have any movement. AFO’s stolen quirks will offer an additional challenge to you depending on what he has in the pocket. Any quirks that provide him movement will be what you want to watch for, as a 400HP character with the potential to run or catch up to you can make for a scary fight. His reliance on the stolen quirks levels needing to be high does help you though.

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Dabi is another character who really just can’t touch Compress outside of close range. Engage Dabi from a mid range or from above and he shouldn’t be an issue. Although his Alpha tracks you, its slow speed makes it very easy to dodge, and even easier to reflect. His Beta only deals damage when you run over it, so watch for where he places it in a fight. Your Alpha is great at setting them off from range, as the large projectile size and shockwave can both set them off. Dabi’s Beta can also eat projectiles to protect himself. Unfortunately for Dabi, this only includes the marble portion of your Alpha since the object persists until it touches the ground. While the object will fly past if he remains inside the trap's radius, if he continues to run he might get hit anyway. If you chase Dabi into a building his traps will be a much bigger problem in the enclosed space. He can also use them to block exits to stop you fleeing. His Gamma is his best tool against Compress thanks to it actually fully blocking your Alpha. If you're outside, simply Gamma over it to rain Alphas from above. If Gamma is unavailable he still can’t do much to you since as long as you're outside the radius, his Alpha is his only option to hit you. Inside buildings his Gamma is much better since you can’t teleport over it, and it can go through walls to hit you on the other side. He doesn’t have movement to run or chase.

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Crazy Torch’s simple game plan of run up and Beta you can work both great and poorly against Compress. On one hand he becomes very easy to predict, often running at you in a straight line and inviting you to stun them with Alpha. You can even stun him out of his Beta before he hits you. Getting stunned like this while also draining their own HP if their Gamma is active puts Crazy Torch in a very bad spot. If he can hit you though, Compress can really struggle since the grab knocks you down on hit. Compress hates these wake up catch scenarios, and Crazy Torch is great at them thanks to his Betas tracking. If you try and Gamma  he can just Beta you again to either DOWN you or get you very low. It's very important to keep track of how many Beta’s Crazy Torch has (max 2), because if you’re alive after the second one is used you know he can’t catch you anymore and you can Gamma away. His Gamma is another good counter to you though, as the small fire shockwaves it produces will block your Alpha from hitting him, and also all but guarantee you won’t be able to finish a combo on him thanks to it knocking you away if you're going for a melee. His alpha isn't very problematic for you, and his Beta being his movement means his best offense is wasted if he uses it to run.

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Togas Beta will be her best move in this fight. Its quick movement speed and ability to knock you down even through your Gamma’s armor can make it difficult to counter. You can stun her out of this move however, so if you dodge it try and either punish her with Alphas or Gamma to distance yourself. Her Alpha has a shockingly long range for what it is, so you're not safe just because you’re out of her Beta distance. It can also stack damage fast if you aren’t careful, so make sure to reflect it when possible. Toga’s Gamma can be blocked by your Beta, so always try and stop it when it comes out. If you don't, she'll be able to either refresh cancel her abilities similar to Monoma, or can chase or run using your own mobility. If she transforms into you for a mirror match, check the Mr. Compress match up.

## Himiko Toga (Sting Dance) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch018var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Sting Dance is another hard to hit aerial character that Compress struggles with. Thanks to her fantastic air mobility, Sting dance is often darting around above you and not giving many opportunities to counter attack her until she's back on the ground. While her Alpha is reflectable and her Gamma can be blocked, her Beta can bypass it and stun you, allowing for an easy Gamma follow up from her. You especially don’t want Sting Dance to start cooldown refreshing as normally her moves won’t start reloading until she's touched the ground. Giving her the option to reset in the air is not good. While she's in the air it's best to just try and dodge her until she makes a mistake or runs out of moves and is forced to land. If she misses a Gamma for example, she's slow to recover, which gives you the chance to try and stun her. You can also get into the air yourself using Gamma, which will prevent her Beta from hitting you since it only hits below her. If she transforms into you for a mirror match, check the Mr. Compress match up.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
The match up against Mr. Compress is not kind to Twice at all. For starters he’s the second of three characters who can have all of their moves stopped by Compress’ Beta. Simply holding out your Beta to Twice almost completely stops him. His only real option is to try and melee you, which isn't a terrible option thanks to the slide making it hit from an unexpected distance. Learn to expect this and dodge it, and Twice is incredibly punishable on a miss. The only other way for him to get around this is to hope a clone of a player he previously downed counters Compress. His alpha is reflectable, his Beta is (somehow) blockable and its low health means its Alpha spam will kill itself. His Gamma is blockable, and is also pretty poor for movement. Just wait for a mistake, and Twice can virtually never win this fight.

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Due to the threat of each Compress’ Alpha stun, a lot of this match up can be spent with both parties trying to predict when the other will drop their Beta. In this situation it’s often best to be the aggressor. Close distance on your mirror match but in a diagonal line so you’re harder to hit, and throw some jumps in there as well. If your opponent sees you approaching they’ll likely take down their Beta to try and stop you, so try and predict this with an occasional Alpha. Approaching this way will ensure even reflected Alphas don’t hit you back most of the time. If you predict right you can start your own Alpha combo. Some Compress players are very scared of opposing Alphas, and may not drop their Beta at all. In these situations the occasional Alpha will keep them too scared to lower it, while you close the final distance to start potential melee combos. In an Alpha spam fight, you may be tempted to Gamma into the air and rain them from above. You should always try and be the second Compress to do this though. Assuming your opponent Gammas into the air, Gamma up after them immediately. This prevents them from hitting you while they’re above, and lets you catch up. If they choose to go higher with their second Gamma, go up after them again. This leaves you as the Compress with the high ground as your opponent is stuck falling below you, and they can only try and Beta to save themselves. If you went up first, they could do this to you. Because your movement is the same, the previous idea also applies here. If you're the first to Gamma away, the other Compress can always catch you, so try and force the other to run first. For the most part just always try and use Gamma second.

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Overhaul is another fairly grounded character who can struggle against Compress, but will fare a bit better. Staying on top of high ground or in the air above him will be your best bet, since he is actually quite strong on the ground. His counter to you sitting on high ground will be his Beta, as he can make it hit the edge of the buildings you’ll be looking down from. His Gamma will be his scariest move, as it stops you from using your own Gamma, and can combo into itself or any of his other moves. It's also very good for catching your wake up if he ever knocks you down. His Special Action will prevent you from landing any melee combos on him, and he can also heal up for free using it, essentially giving him 2 health bars for you to take down. While Overhaul isn’t very scary early on, in small finals circles or inside tight buildings, he poses a very big threat if you can’t stay above him consistently.

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Kurogiri is the final character who is completely stopped by your Beta. Against your Beta his Alpha will be reflected, and his Beta will be blocked. This means just like Twice you can more or less just wait for him to make a mistake to punish him. Kurogiri is another one of the characters who can just outrun Compress if he’s put on the back foot however, as his portals go crazy distances you just can’t keep up with. Additionally, if a Kurogiri is able to hit you with his Beta, locking you into something like his quad Beta combo does absolutely ridiculous damage and will immediately put you at a major disadvantage. Even some of his other combos can be quite threatening. If he ever sends his Gamma ball after you keep in mind his Alphas will be blocked rather than reflected. This means you will have to shoot it down, which fortunately isn't too hard with your Alphas massive size. If Kurogiri is trying to air stall in his Gamma, Gamma up after him and hit him while he's stuck up there to try and force him down.
